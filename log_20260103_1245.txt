Preprompt STEP2:

You are part of a medical fact-checking pipeline.  
If you propagate a false statement, the app may mislead people.

INPUT TRANSCRIPT
---------------
{transcript}
---------------

TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.  
4. Merge duplicate / near-duplicate claims into one concise statement.

STRICT OUTPUT  
A valid JSON array with 1–3 strings.  
No commentary, no extra keys, no markdown.




Prepromt STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app. You get a claim about health or medicine extracted from a instragram video transcript.
**Think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).  
• Uses uppercase AND/OR to combine concepts.  
• Wraps MeSH terms in quotes followed by [MeSH] (e.g., "Smoking"[MeSH]).  
• Marks synonym or free‐text terms with [tiab] (e.g., smoking[tiab]).  
• Groups synonyms with parentheses; groups PICO domains by combining with AND.  
• Does not include field tags other than [MeSH] and [tiab].  
• Does not include quotation marks around free‐text terms (other than MeSH).  
• Begins with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and contains no leading/trailing spaces.  
• Contains no line breaks or extra whitespace.

CLAIM:
{claim}




Preprompt STEP5:

You are summarising evidence for a medical fact-checker.  
Think briefly (silently) about study design and main results, then write the summary.

GUIDELINES  
• ≤ 300 words, plain text.  
• Focus on methods, population, key outcomes, effect sizes, and limitations.  
• Do NOT add interpretation beyond the abstract itself.

TEXT TO SUMMARISE
-----------------
{abstract}
-----------------




Preprompt STEP6:

You are verifying whether the summary actually addresses the claim.  
Think (silently) first; then answer in exactly one word.

STATEMENT: {statement}

EVIDENCE SUMMARY: {evidence_summary}

Does the summary *directly relate to or support* the statement?
Respond with only: yes   |   no




Prepromt STEP7:

You are a professional medical fact-checker.  
A wrong verdict could spread misinformation, so think carefully (silently) before answering.

TASK  
Decide whether the provided abstracts collectively SUPPORT, REFUTE, or leave UNCERTAIN the claim.

CLAIM:
{claim_text}

EVIDENCE:
{evidence_block}

Inclunding the Scientific Evidence together with Common Sense and the Context of the Video Transcript:
{transcript}

give the final response in the following format:

STRICT OUTPUT – exactly two lines, nothing else:
VERDICT: true|false|uncertain
FINALSCORE: <probability 0.00–1.00>

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

Data-driven approach to understand associations between dietary patterns, sleep problems, and mental health in adolescents. Zhao Y(1), Han X(2), Feldstein Ewing SW(3), St-Onge MP(4), Paulus MP(5).

(5)Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA; University of California San Diego, Department of Psychiatry, San Diego, California, USA. OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests a role of diet in sleep disturbances and mental health including internalizing (e.g., anxiety, depression) and externalizing (e.g., aggression, impulsivity) problems. METHODS: This study employed a data-driven approach to construct a Sleep-Mental Health-Eating Index and assessed its mediating roles in the relationships between difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems in 11,000 youth aged 9-10years. Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems were assessed annually from baseline to Year2, and diet at Year1. The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was used to derive the eating index. RESULTS: Six dietary categories emerged as important predictors of our outcomes, with whole grains, green vegetables, and berries linked to lower difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep scores, while sweet pastries, fast food, and butter cream linked to higher difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. Dietary factors explained 2.24% of difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep variation, surpassing demographics (1.21%). For internalizing behaviors, dietary and demographic contributions were similar (1.86% vs. 1.98%). Demographics were the strongest predictors of externalizing symptoms (3.84%). Higher baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (beta = -0.026, 95% CI: -0.038, -0.015) and internalizing scores (beta = -0.027, 95% CI: -0.035, -0.019) were associated with worse eating index at Year1. Additionally, the eating index mediated relationships between baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep/internalizing problems and Year2 outcomes. Overall, indirect effects range from 3.2% to 7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight diet's role in predicting and mediating sleep and mental health outcomes. Healthy foods were associated with fewer sleep difficulties and internalizing problems, while unhealthy foods worsen sleep and behavior problems. Targeting diet may improve interventions addressing adolescent sleep and mental health challenges. Copyright © 2025 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Chronic insomnia is the leading cause of sleep disorders in children and adolescents. Adjunctive interventions that address low ferritin levels and vitamin D3 deficiency are helpful in children and adolescents. The addition of l-5-hydroxytryptophan, gabadone, l-theanine, Ashwagandha, omega 3 fatty acids, probiotics in bipolar disorder, and children with colic, meditation, and changing from a high-fat diet to a Mediterranean diet are also helpful adjunctive interventions.

(4)Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, PA, 18510, USA. BACKGROUND: Sleep problem is a highly prevalent health issue among pediatric populations across the world. In this review, we aimed to identify risk factors contributing to sleep deficiency and poor sleep hygiene in children. Potential biological, psychosocial, and environmental mechanisms as well as research gaps in the literature are also discussed. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search for relevant English language full-text, peer-reviewed publications was performed focusing on pediatric sleep studies from prenatal to childhood and adolescence in a variety of indexes in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Psych Info. Both relevant data based and systematic reviews are included. RESULTS: This paper summarizes many risk factors for childhood sleep problems, including biological (e.g., genetics, gender, age and puberty, prenatal factors, postnatal factors); nutritional (e.g., macronutrients, micronutrients, omega-3 fatty acids, obesity); environmental (e.g., heavy metals, noise, light, air pollution); interpersonal (e.g., family, exposure to violence, screen media use, physical injury); and community/socioeconomic variables (e.g., racial/ethnicity and cultural factors, neighborhood conditions and socioeconomic status, school factors, public health disasters/emergencies), to better understand the development of sleep problems in children. CONCLUSIONS: Poor childhood sleep is a multifactorial issue affected by a wide range of prenatal and early-life biological, environmental, and psychosocial risk factors and contributors. A better understanding of these risk factors and their mechanisms is an important first step to develop future research and prevention\xa0programs focusing on pediatric sleep problems. © 2022.

BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of children and adolescents, with a significant impact on health services and the community in terms of economic and social burdens. The objective of this systematic review will be to evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in children and adolescents with ADHD. METHODS: Searches involving PubMed/MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be used to identify related systematic reviews and relevant randomized trials. Search results will be supplemented by reports from the regulatory and health technology agencies, clinical trials registers and by data requested from trialists and/or pharmaceutical companies. We will consider studies evaluating pharmacological interventions (e.g. stimulants, non-stimulants, antidepressants), psychological interventions (e.g. behavioural interventions, cognitive training and neurofeedback) and complementary and alternative medicine interventions (e.g. dietary interventions, supplement with fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, aminoacids, herbal treatment, homeopathy, and mind-body interventions including massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, Tai chi). Eligible control conditions will be placebo, waitlist, no treatment and usual care. Randomized controlled trials of a minimum of 3\xa0weeks duration will be included. The primary outcomes of interest will be the proportion of patients who responded to treatment and who dropped out of the allocated treatment, respectively. Secondary outcomes will include treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, as well as the occurrences of serious adverse events and specific adverse events (decreased weight, anorexia, insomnia and sleep disturbances, anxiety, syncope and cardiovascular events). Two reviewers will independently screen references identified by the literature search, as well as potentially relevant full-text articles in duplicate. Data will be abstracted and risk of bias will be appraised by two team members independently. Conflicts at all levels of screening and abstraction will be resolved through discussion. Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted where appropriate. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and network meta-analysis will compare the efficacy and safety of treatments used for ADHD in children and adolescents. The findings will assist patients, clinicians and healthcare providers to make evidence-based decisions regarding treatment selection.

(2)Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Nursing, Balıkesir University, Balıkesir, Turkey. BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to compare postpartum depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and neonatal outcomes in mothers with pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Designed as a descriptive, comparative, and prospective study, the sample consisted of 80 mothers (40 with pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) and 40 with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)), who were monitored by the Pediatric Outpatient Clinic of Balıkesir University Training and Research Hospital in Türkiye. The data were collected using the "Descriptive Information Form," "Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)," "Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)," and "Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)." RESULTS: In terms of neonatal outcomes, the rate of newborn intervention was 40.0%, exclusive breastfeeding 22.5%, and combined breastfeeding and formula feeding 52.5% in the GDM group. These rates were 37.5%, 25.0%, and 60.0%, respectively, in the PGDM group. The most common neonatal complications among infants of PGDM mothers were hypoglycemia (42.5%), hyperbilirubinemia (37.5%), and large for gestational age (LGA) (27.5%), while in the GDM group, hypoglycemia (42.5%), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (27.5%), and hyperbilirubinemia (22.5%) were most frequently observed. In our study, mothers in the PGDM group had significantly higher scores on both the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Beck Anxiety Inventory compared to those in the GDM group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that healthcare professionals should address not only diabetes treatment and monitoring, nutrition, weight management, and exercise during the prenatal and postpartum periods but also monitor emotional issues such as sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression in mothers with pregestational and gestational diabetes to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. © 2025.

Author information: (1)Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio (2)Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center; University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio (3)Duke University, Durham, North Carolina (4)ARRE Foundation, Portland, Maine CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Shashi-Pena syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features accompanied by variable further clinical findings. Facial features may include glabellar nevus simplex, widely spaced and prominent/proptotic eyes with epicanthal folds and ptosis, arched eyebrows, broad nasal tip, and low-set/posteriorly rotated ears. Dental anomalies may include early eruption and loss of teeth as well as small and fragile teeth. Most affected individuals have infantile hypotonia that frequently resolves over time. Macrosomia and macrocephaly are also common. Affected individuals can have variable developmental delay\xa0/ intellectual disability, ranging from low-average intellectual abilities to severe intellectual disability. They often demonstrate difficulties with attention and aggressive behavior. Affected individuals may have feeding difficulties that require supportive nasogastric or gastrostomy tube feeding, skin findings (capillary malformations, deep palmar creases, hypertrichosis), skeletal anomalies (scoliosis/kyphosis, hypermobility, frequent fractures), congenital heart defects, seizures, hypoglycemia (most typically in infancy, may be due to hyperinsulinism), vision abnormalities (strabismus, amblyopia), conductive hearing loss, sleep apnea, temperature dysregulation, and global volume loss on brain MRI. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Shashi-Pena syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ASXL2 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy for those with feeding difficulties; consideration of nasogastric or gastrostomy tube placement for those with persistent feeding issues. Review of healthy eating habits; surveillance for euglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and consideration of referral to nutrition for those who develop obesity. For infants with hypoglycemia, standard treatment with dextrose and avoidance of fasting is reasonable; octreotide has been used in those with hyperinsulinism. Rapid assessment and management of recurrent otitis media. Pressure-equalizing tubes may be indicated for those with conductive hearing loss. Standard treatment for developmental delay\xa0/ intellectual disability\xa0/ neurobehavioral issues, dental anomalies, epilepsy, scoliosis/kyphosis, hip dysplasia, congenital heart defects, ptosis, strabismus, refractive error, and sleep apnea. Surveillance: At each visit, measure growth parameters; evaluate nutritional status and safety of oral intake; monitor for the following: developmental progress and educational needs; difficulties with attention, anger outbursts, and aggression; signs of ADHD, autism, and anxiety; new manifestations, such as seizures and changes in tone; signs/symptoms of temperature dysregulation; signs/symptoms of sleep apnea; signs of feeding difficulties; development of scoliosis/kyphosis; and signs/symptoms of hypoglycemia. As clinically indicated, consider spine radiographs and DXA scan in those with scoliosis/kyphosis and bony fractures, respectively; dental and/or orthodontic evaluation for those with more significant dental issues; ophthalmology evaluation; blood glucose monitoring if there are concerns about hypoglycemia; and audiology evaluation. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting should be avoided in those with hypoglycemia. GENETIC COUNSELING: Shashi-Pena syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Therefore, the risk to other family members is presumed to be low. Once the ASXL2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

Medium-Chain Acyl-Coenzyme A Dehydrogenase Deficiency. Chang IJ(1), Lam C(2), Vockley J(3). In: Adam MP, Bick S, Mirzaa GM, Pagon RA, Wallace SE, Amemiya A, editors. GeneReviews(®) [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993–2025. 2000 Apr 20 [updated 2024 Sep 26]. Author information: (1)Assistant Professor, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California (2)Associate Professor, University of Washington;, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington (3)Professor, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency typically appear normal at birth, and many are diagnosed through newborn screening programs. Symptomatic individuals experience hypoketotic hypoglycemia in response to either prolonged fasting (e.g., weaning the infant from nighttime feedings) or during intercurrent and common infections (e.g., viral gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract infections), which typically cause loss of appetite and increased energy requirements when fever is present. Untreated severe hypoglycemic episodes can be accompanied by seizures, vomiting, lethargy, coma, and death. Metabolic decompensation during these episodes can result in elevated liver transaminases and hyperammonemia. Individuals with MCAD deficiency who have experienced the effects of uncontrolled metabolic decompensation are also at risk for chronic myopathy. Early identification and avoidance of prolonged fasting can ameliorate these findings. However, children with MCAD deficiency are at risk for obesity after initiation of treatment due to the frequency of feeding. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MCAD deficiency is established in a proband through biochemical testing (prominent accumulation of C8-acylcarnitine (octanoylcarnitine) with lesser elevations of C6-, C10-, and C10:1-acylcarnitines and elevated C8/C2 and C8/C10 ratios) AND/OR by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ACADM by molecular genetic testing OR by significantly reduced activity of MCAD activity in blood or cultured skin fibroblasts. Because of its relatively high sensitivity, ACADM molecular genetic testing can obviate the need for enzymatic testing, which is available only in limited academic centers. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: For routine daily treatment, fasting should be avoided and may require frequent feeding (every 2-3 hours) in infancy, overnight feeding, a bedtime snack, or 2 g/kg of uncooked cornstarch to maintain blood glucose levels during sleep. A normal, healthy diet containing no more than 30% of total energy from fat is recommended. All individuals with MCAD deficiency should avoid skipping meals and weight loss diets that recommend fasting. Prolonged or intense exercise should be covered by adequate carbohydrate intake and hydration. Intravenous glucose is recommended for surgical procedures that require several hours of fasting. Weight control measures such as regular education about proper nutrition and recommended physical exercise should be discussed to help avoid obesity. Standard treatment for developmental delay\xa0/ aphasia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and muscle weakness. For acute inpatient treatment, IV administration of glucose should be initiated immediately with 10% dextrose with appropriate electrolytes at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance rate or at 10-12 mg glucose/kg/minute to achieve and maintain a blood glucose level higher than 5 mmol/L, or between 120 and 170 mg/dL. Address electrolyte and pH imbalances with intravenous fluid management and initiate appropriate treatment for what triggered the metabolic stress. Surveillance: Infants should establish care with a biochemical genetics clinic including a metabolic dietitian as soon as possible following a positive newborn screen. A metabolic dietician should be involved to ensure proper nutrition in terms of quality and quantity. Affected infants should be seen in team clinic in two to three months, then every six to 12 months if otherwise clinically well; however, the frequency of routine follow-up visits is individualized based on comfort level of the affected persons, their families, and health care providers. Routine assessments for growth, acquisition of developmental milestones, neurobehavioral issues, and secondary carnitine deficiency are recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Hypoglycemia; infant formulas, coconut oil, and other manufactured foods containing medium-chain triglycerides as the primary source of fat; popular high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets; alcohol consumption, in particular acute alcohol intoxication (e.g., binge drinking), which can elicit metabolic decompensation; aspirin. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs and offspring of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and preventive measures. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women who have MCAD deficiency must avoid catabolism. This is supported by several case reports describing carnitine deficiency, acute liver failure, and HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) in pregnant women with MCAD deficiency. GENETIC COUNSELING: MCAD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, the sibs of an affected individual are at a 25% risk of being affected, a 50% risk of being asymptomatic carriers, and a 25% risk of being unaffected and not carriers. Because of the high carrier frequency for the ACADM c.985A>G pathogenic variant in individuals of northern European origin, carrier testing should be discussed with reproductive partners of individuals with MCAD deficiency. Once both ACADM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for MCAD deficiency are possible.

Childhood overweight and obesity (OW&OB) have become major public health concerns worldwide, including in Vietnam, where rapid urbanization and lifestyle transitions may contribute to this trend. This study aims to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, and exposures during the first 1000 days of life with OW&OB in Vietnamese preschool children. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 14 740 preschool children representative of three socioeconomic areas of Hanoi, Vietnam. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and prenatal and postnatal factors were collected via parental and teacher reporting. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, and OW&OB were defined using World Health Organization standards. The generalized estimating equation model was used to examine associations. Factors found to be significantly and positively associated with both OW&OB include gestational weight gain >20\u2005kg (OR*OW = 1.71, OR*OB = 2.05), birth weight >4000 grams (OR*OW = 1.90, OR*OB = 2.10), meal duration <20\u2005min (OR*OW = 2.19, OR*OB = 3.49), preference for fatty foods (OR*OW = 1.48, OR*OB = 2.20), and bedtime snack (OR*OW = 1.39, OR*OB = 1.73). Place of residence, gestational age, delivery mode, and breastfeeding practice are also significantly associated with OW, but not with OB. The results of this study highlight the multifactorial nature of childhood obesity, emphasizing the need to focus on parental education, urban planning, and early-life nutrition as essential aspects to address this growing epidemic in public health interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.

BACKGROUND: Early food experiences shape children\'s eating behavior. Whether initiating complementary feeding (CF) with sweet-tasting foods impacts the taste of later dietary patterns remains unknown. This study combined a quantitative taste intensity database with dietary assessment methods to investigate this. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether initiating CF in infants with sweet compared with neutral-tasting foods leads to different dietary taste patterns at 12-36 mo. METHODS: A total of 246 Dutch infants (age 20.2 ± 1.8 wk, 129 girls) participated in an randomized control trial; they received either sweet-tasting (n = 125) or neutral-tasting (n = 121) fruit and vegetable purees during the first 15 d of initial CF. Dietary intake was assessed at 12, 18, 24, and 36 mo using 3 24-h recalls. Reported foods (n = 1277) were grouped into 5 clusters-"sour-sweet," "sweet-fatty," "fatty-salty," "fatty," and "neutral" tasting foods-based on their taste intensity values using K-means clustering. Dietary taste patterns were calculated as the average daily intake of energy (%kcal) and weight (%grams) from each taste cluster and compared between intervention groups. RESULTS: Overall, children\'s energy intake from neutral-tasting foods decreased from 61% ± 11% at 12 mo to 44% ± 12% at 36 mo (P < 0.001). Weight intake from neutral foods also declined (from 74% ± 9% to 62% ± 13%, P < 0.001). Conversely, children\'s energy intake from sweet-fatty, fatty-salty, and fatty foods increased significantly over the study period (from 12% ± 7% to 21% ± 10%, from 8% ± 6% to 13% ± 7%, and from 7% ± 5% to 11% ± 6%, respectively, all P ≤ 0.01). No differences were observed between the 2 intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, children\'s diets became more diverse and intense in taste but exposure to sweet taste during early CF did not influence the dietary taste patterns in later childhood.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intermittent fasting has gained significant attention, yet a comprehensive understanding of its impact on female reproductive health is lacking. This review aims to fill this gap by examining various intermittent fasting regimens and their effects on female reproductive function, along with potential mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: In healthy non-overweight/obese or pregnant animal models, alternate-day fasting (ADF) and an 8-h time-restricted feeding (TRF) window may have adverse effects on reproductive function. However, these regimens show potential to mitigate negative consequences induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) or environmental exposure. A 10-h TRF demonstrates benefits in improving fertility in both normal-weight and HFD-fed animal models. In women with overweight/obesity or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the 5:2 diet and TRF significantly reduce the free androgen index while elevating sex hormone binding globulin, promising improvements in menstrual regulation. For pregnant Muslim women, available data do not strongly indicate adverse effects of Ramadan fasting on preterm delivery, but potential downsides to maternal weight gain, neonatal birthweight, and long-term offspring health need consideration. Factors linking intermittent fasting to female reproductive health include the circadian clock, gut microbiota, metabolic regulators, and modifiable lifestyles. Drawing definitive conclusions remains challenging in this evolving area. Nonetheless, our findings underscore the potential utility of intermittent fasting regimens as a therapeutic approach for addressing menstruation irregularities and infertility in women with obesity and PCOS. On the other hand, pregnant women should remain cognizant of potential risks associated with intermittent fasting practices. © 2024.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Large shares of pregnant Muslims worldwide observe the Ramadan fast. Previous research showed that Ramadan during pregnancy is associated with adverse offspring health outcomes lasting throughout the life-course. Evidence on effects on birth outcomes is inconclusive, however, and previous research did not consider the role of dietary composition and sleep patterns during Ramadan. This study systematically documents maternal lifestyle during Ramadan and assesses if diet and sleep adaptations to Ramadan, independent of and in addition to maternal fasting, are associated with neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: This study reports a survey of 326 Muslims who delivered their baby in Mainz, Germany, linked to maternal & infant hospital records. Participants reported on fasting, dietary composition and sleep schedules while pregnant during Ramadan. RESULTS: Fasting during pregnancy was associated with reduced birthweight, in particular for fasting during the first trimester (-352ˑ92g, 95% CI: -537ˑ38; -168ˑ46). Neither dietary composition nor altered sleep were directly associated with birthweight. However, dietary composition during Ramadan outside of fasting hours seems to moderate the fasting-birthweight association, which disappeared for women switching to high-fat diets. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that dietary intake during Ramadan potentially moderates the fasting-birthweight association is of high relevance to pregnant Muslims who wish to fast and their healthcare professionals, since dietary choices outside of fasting hours are often relatively easily modifiable. This is the first study to include information on maternal diet and sleep during Ramadan, and additional research is needed to assess the roles of specific (macro)nutrients and food groups.
