TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.  
4. Merge duplicate / near-duplicate claims into one concise statement.

STRICT OUTPUT  
A valid JSON array with 1–3 strings.  
No commentary, no extra keys, no markdown.




Prepromt STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app.  
If the claim is too vague, non‐medical, or otherwise unlikely to be indexed in PubMed, output the single word: NONE

Otherwise, **think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).  
• Uses uppercase AND/OR to combine concepts.  
• Wraps MeSH terms in quotes followed by [MeSH] (e.g., "Smoking"[MeSH]).  
• Marks synonym or free‐text terms with [tiab] (e.g., smoking[tiab]).  
• Groups synonyms with parentheses; groups PICO domains by combining with AND.  
• Does not include field tags other than [MeSH] and [tiab].  
• Does not include quotation marks around free‐text terms (other than MeSH).  
• Begins with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and contains no leading/trailing spaces.  
• Contains no line breaks or extra whitespace.

CLAIM:
{claim}




Preprompt STEP5:

You are summarising evidence for a medical fact-checker.  
Think briefly (silently) about study design and main results, then write the summary.

GUIDELINES  
• ≤ 300 words, plain text.  
• Focus on methods, population, key outcomes, effect sizes, and limitations.  
• Do NOT add interpretation beyond the abstract itself.

TEXT TO SUMMARISE
-----------------
{abstract}
-----------------




Preprompt STEP6:

You are verifying whether the summary actually addresses the claim.  
Think (silently) first; then answer in exactly one word.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

 Evidence Summary: 1. Int Endod J. 2026 Jan 2. doi: 10.1111/iej.70087. Online ahead of print. Histopathology, Diagnosis, Management and Treatment Outcomes of Cemental Tears: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study. Lee AHC(1), Ting MZ(1), Wong MCM(1), Zhang C(1). Author information: (1)Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong, Sai Ying Pun, Hong Kong INTRODUCTION: Diagnosing cemental tears remains challenging, and treatment outcomes can be unpredictable; recommendations for their diagnosis and management are primarily based on case reports and anecdotal experience. Although a classification has been developed for cemental tears, its clinical applicability and importance have yet to be investigated and validated. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to deepen our understanding of cemental tears through a comprehensive examination of a patient cohort, focusing on: (i) evaluating the cases based on the classification for cemental tears; (ii) assessing clinical presentations, radiographic features, and histopathological characteristics; and (iii) identifying factors that influence diagnosis, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated teeth diagnosed with cemental tears at the university's endodontic clinic from September 2019 to June 2024. The review included case histories, clinical, radiographic and histopathological findings, as well as the treatments performed and their outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with 45 teeth diagnosed with cemental tears were included. Majority of affected teeth (68.9%) had received previous treatment or undergone previously initiated therapy. Among those root treated, most (84.6%) exhibited adequate obturation. Pain, swelling and/or sinus tracts, as well as significant crestal bone loss, were detected in approximately half of the cases. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and direct inspection successfully identified all affected teeth, whereas periapical radiographs (PR) only detected 60.0%. Histopathological analysis revealed cementum in all 37 cases comprising 45 teeth, bone in 11 cases, and cystic lesions in 5 cases. Unfavourable treatment outcomes were observed in 78.9% of teeth classified as Class 4-6. Across all classes, regenerative approaches using enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) achieved favourable outcomes in 44.4% of teeth treated, xenografts in 38.1%, and collagen membranes in 55.6%. Notably, none of the teeth in Classes 4-6 treated with EMD or xenografts demonstrated favourable outcomes. CONCLUSION: CBCT scans, direct inspection, and histopathological examination demonstrated a higher detection rate compared to PR. Classification is a critical prognostic factor, with Classes 4-6 exhibiting poorer outcomes than others. The impacts of regenerative approaches on periradicular healing appear questionable. © 2026 The Author(s).

(#)Contributed equally Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) devices guide procedures across numerous diseases, performed on more than 100,000 patients daily worldwide. However, these procedures expose patients and healthcare providers to radiation, increasing the risk of health issues. Despite many low-dose DSA imaging methods proposed, none have been prospectively clinically validated. In this study, 46,829 patients (over 5 million DSA images) from 70 centers were used to iterate our previously developed generative artificial intelligence system (named GenDSA-V2). A total of 1,068 patients (533 in intervention arm and 535 in control arm), with suspected cerebral aneurysms (n = 435), lung cancer (n = 417) or advanced liver cancer (n = 216), meeting surgical criteria, were enrolled to validate the GenDSA-V2. The primary outcome was radiation dose, while secondary outcomes included efficiency, operation time and intraoperative complications. Group assignments were blinded to patients, surgeons and investigators, while technicians were aware but not involved in data collection or analysis. The GenDSA-V2 group showed substantially reduced radiation exposure, with an air kerma (AK) of 151.3 ± 125.1 mGy compared to 457.4 ± 407.4 mGy in the standard clinical protocols (SCP) group (mean difference = -306.1 mGy, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -342.3 to -269.9, P < 0.001 for superiority) and a dose-area product (DAP) of 4009.7 ± 2767.9 μGy m2 versus 12531.6 ± 9145.9 μGy m2 (mean difference = -8521.9 μGy m2, 95% CI = -9333.1 to -7710.7, P < 0.001 for superiority). Mean operation time was 33.1 ± 10.8 min in the SCP group and 34.8 ± 11.8 min in the GenDSA-V2 group (mean difference = 1.7 min, 95% CI = 0.3 to 3.1, P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Complication rates were similar (SCP = 8.1%, GenDSA-V2 = 7.5%, mean difference = -0.6%, 95% CI = -3.8% to 2.6%, P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The GenDSA system reduces radiation exposure to both physicians and patients by approximately two-thirds during DSA-guided procedures, demonstrating substantial clinical and translational value.

Reading literature on kinship in a clinical context: a qualitative study of a reading group for nurses. Schoenau MN(1), Missel M(2)(3), Synnes O(4). Author information: (1)Copenhagen University Hospital Heart Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark mai.nanna.schoenau@regionh.dk. (2)Copenhagen University Hospital Heart Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark. (3)Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark. (4)Centre for Diaconia and Professional Practice, VID Specialized University, Oslo, Norway. Family members, relatives and friends are all affected when someone is hospitalised with a life-threatening illness. However, they often feel neglected and sometimes ignored by healthcare professionals. To address this, the reading of literature has been used in various clinical contexts in an attempt to humanise the care of patients and their relatives. Reading fiction enables healthcare professionals to imaginatively enter relatives' perspectives, fostering a deeper understanding of their experiences, which may in turn enhance family-centred care in clinical practice. However, research on how healthcare professionals engage with the reading of literary texts and what they discuss in such contexts has not yet been explored. This article presents findings from a qualitative study exploring a reading group for nurses at a hospital ward in Denmark, where literature on kinship was read and discussed. We examined the following specific research question: What takes place when nurses join a reading group in a clinical context to read and discuss literature on kinship?Based on a hermeneutical analysis of four audio-recorded reading group sessions, we identified the following three themes: (1) awareness of kinship and the negotiation of norms, (2) engagement with various perspectives and (3) acknowledgement of emotions when caring for family members. These themes are discussed in light of Felski's concept of recognition as knowing and acknowledgement. Additionally, by applying Meretoja's theory of narrative agency, we demonstrate how reading literature in a clinical setting can foster narrative agency, enabling nurses to expand and clarify their understandings and assumptions of kinship based on their ability to navigate and influence what Meretoja terms their 'narrative environment' in a clinical context. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

However, these procedures expose patients and healthcare providers to radiation, increasing the risk of health issues. Despite many low-dose DSA imaging methods proposed, none have been prospectively clinically validated. In this study, 46,829 patients (over 5 million DSA images) from 70 centers were used to iterate our previously developed generative artificial intelligence system (named GenDSA-V2). A total of 1,068 patients (533 in intervention arm and 535 in control arm), with suspected cerebral aneurysms (n = 435), lung cancer (n = 417) or advanced liver cancer (n = 216), meeting surgical criteria, were enrolled to validate the GenDSA-V2. The primary outcome was radiation dose, while secondary outcomes included efficiency, operation time and intraoperative complications. Group assignments were blinded to patients, surgeons and investigators, while technicians were aware but not involved in data collection or analysis. The GenDSA-V2 group showed substantially reduced radiation exposure, with an air kerma (AK) of 151.3 ± 125.1 mGy compared to 457.4 ± 407.4 mGy in the standard clinical protocols (SCP) group (mean difference = -306.1 mGy, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -342.3 to -269.9, P < 0.001 for superiority) and a dose-area product (DAP) of 4009.7 ± 2767.9 μGy m2 versus 12531.6 ± 9145.9 μGy m2 (mean difference = -8521.9 μGy m2, 95% CI = -9333.1 to -7710.7, P < 0.001 for superiority). Mean operation time was 33.1 ± 10.8 min in the SCP group and 34.8 ± 11.8 min in the GenDSA-V2 group (mean difference = 1.7 min, 95% CI = 0.3 to 3.1, P < 0.001 for noninferiority). Complication rates were similar (SCP = 8.1%, GenDSA-V2 = 7.5%, mean difference = -0.6%, 95% CI = -3.8% to 2.6%, P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The GenDSA system reduces radiation exposure to both physicians and patients by approximately two-thirds during DSA-guided procedures, demonstrating substantial clinical and translational value.

Histopathology, Diagnosis, Management and Treatment Outcomes of Cemental Tears: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study. Lee AHC(1), Ting MZ(1), Wong MCM(1), Zhang C(1). Author information: (1)Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong, Sai Ying Pun, Hong Kong INTRODUCTION: Diagnosing cemental tears remains challenging, and treatment outcomes can be unpredictable; recommendations for their diagnosis and management are primarily based on case reports and anecdotal experience. Although a classification has been developed for cemental tears, its clinical applicability and importance have yet to be investigated and validated. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to deepen our understanding of cemental tears through a comprehensive examination of a patient cohort, focusing on: (i) evaluating the cases based on the classification for cemental tears; (ii) assessing clinical presentations, radiographic features, and histopathological characteristics; and (iii) identifying factors that influence diagnosis, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated teeth diagnosed with cemental tears at the university's endodontic clinic from September 2019 to June 2024. The review included case histories, clinical, radiographic and histopathological findings, as well as the treatments performed and their outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with 45 teeth diagnosed with cemental tears were included. Majority of affected teeth (68.9%) had received previous treatment or undergone previously initiated therapy. Among those root treated, most (84.6%) exhibited adequate obturation. Pain, swelling and/or sinus tracts, as well as significant crestal bone loss, were detected in approximately half of the cases. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and direct inspection successfully identified all affected teeth, whereas periapical radiographs (PR) only detected 60.0%. Histopathological analysis revealed cementum in all 37 cases comprising 45 teeth, bone in 11 cases, and cystic lesions in 5 cases. Unfavourable treatment outcomes were observed in 78.9% of teeth classified as Class 4-6. Across all classes, regenerative approaches using enamel matrix derivatives (EMD) achieved favourable outcomes in 44.4% of teeth treated, xenografts in 38.1%, and collagen membranes in 55.6%. Notably, none of the teeth in Classes 4-6 treated with EMD or xenografts demonstrated favourable outcomes. CONCLUSION: CBCT scans, direct inspection, and histopathological examination demonstrated a higher detection rate compared to PR. Classification is a critical prognostic factor, with Classes 4-6 exhibiting poorer outcomes than others. The impacts of regenerative approaches on periradicular healing appear questionable. © 2026 The Author(s).

Reading literature on kinship in a clinical context: a qualitative study of a reading group for nurses. Schoenau MN(1), Missel M(2)(3), Synnes O(4). Author information: (1)Copenhagen University Hospital Heart Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark mai.nanna.schoenau@regionh.dk. (2)Copenhagen University Hospital Heart Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark. (3)Copenhagen University, Copenhagen, Denmark. (4)Centre for Diaconia and Professional Practice, VID Specialized University, Oslo, Norway. Family members, relatives and friends are all affected when someone is hospitalised with a life-threatening illness. However, they often feel neglected and sometimes ignored by healthcare professionals. To address this, the reading of literature has been used in various clinical contexts in an attempt to humanise the care of patients and their relatives. Reading fiction enables healthcare professionals to imaginatively enter relatives' perspectives, fostering a deeper understanding of their experiences, which may in turn enhance family-centred care in clinical practice. However, research on how healthcare professionals engage with the reading of literary texts and what they discuss in such contexts has not yet been explored. This article presents findings from a qualitative study exploring a reading group for nurses at a hospital ward in Denmark, where literature on kinship was read and discussed. We examined the following specific research question: What takes place when nurses join a reading group in a clinical context to read and discuss literature on kinship?Based on a hermeneutical analysis of four audio-recorded reading group sessions, we identified the following three themes: (1) awareness of kinship and the negotiation of norms, (2) engagement with various perspectives and (3) acknowledgement of emotions when caring for family members. These themes are discussed in light of Felski's concept of recognition as knowing and acknowledgement. Additionally, by applying Meretoja's theory of narrative agency, we demonstrate how reading literature in a clinical setting can foster narrative agency, enabling nurses to expand and clarify their understandings and assumptions of kinship based on their ability to navigate and influence what Meretoja terms their 'narrative environment' in a clinical context. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2026.

{'transcript': "Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else.
