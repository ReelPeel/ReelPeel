{transcript}
---------------

TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.  
4. Merge duplicate / near-duplicate claims into one concise statement.

STRICT OUTPUT  
A valid JSON array with 1–3 strings.  
No commentary, no extra keys, no markdown.




Prepromt STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app.  
If the claim is too vague, non‐medical, or otherwise unlikely to be indexed in PubMed, output the single word: NONE

Otherwise, **think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).  
• Uses uppercase AND/OR to combine concepts.  
• Wraps MeSH terms in quotes followed by [MeSH] (e.g., "Smoking"[MeSH]).  
• Marks synonym or free‐text terms with [tiab] (e.g., smoking[tiab]).  
• Groups synonyms with parentheses; groups PICO domains by combining with AND.  
• Does not include field tags other than [MeSH] and [tiab].  
• Does not include quotation marks around free‐text terms (other than MeSH).  
• Begins with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and contains no leading/trailing spaces.  
• Contains no line breaks or extra whitespace.

CLAIM:
{claim}




Preprompt STEP5:

You are summarising evidence for a medical fact-checker.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

1. Lasers Med Sci. 2025 Dec 20;40(1):533. doi: 10.1007/s10103-025-04790-4. A single photobiomodulation session selectively improves vocal stability and respiratory capacity in teachers with severe vocal fatigue. Garrido A(1), Zangaro R(2), Neto OP(3)(4). Author information: (1)CITE, Anhembi Morumbi University, São Paulo, Brazil. fonogarrido@gmail.com. (2)CITE, Anhembi Morumbi University, São Paulo, Brazil.

Vocal fatigue (VF) is a significant occupational burden for professional voice users, such as teachers, for whom rapid and effective interventions remain limited. Photobiomodulation (PBM), a noninvasive therapy that uses low-intensity light to mitigate inflammation and promote tissue repair, is a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, we investigated the immediate effects of a single PBM session on key acoustic and respiratory parameters in female teachers with VF. In this single-arm, pre-post clinical trial, we enrolled 41 female primary school teachers (age range: 28-40 years) with symptoms of vocal fatigue classified as mild (n = 19), moderate (n = 18), or severe (n = 4). A single 5-minute PBM session was administered to the laryngeal region using a light-emitting diode (LED) device delivering 1 W of optical power across two wavelengths (640 and 940 nm). Acoustic parameters (jitter, shimmer, and connected speech frequency) and respiratory capacity were measured before and immediately after the intervention. In the severe subgroup, jitter decreased (p = 0.005) and mean autocorrelation increased (p = 0.024), while connected speech (p = 0.056) and respiratory capacity (p = 0.058) showed trends toward improvement. In the moderate subgroup, peak flow increased (p = 0.002). No meaningful changes were observed in the mild subgroup. A single session of photobiomodulation therapy resulted in immediate and significant improvements in vocal quality and respiratory function, particularly in teachers with severe vocal fatigue. These findings position PBM as a promising non-invasive tool for rapid vocal rehabilitation in individuals with pronounced phonatory deficits. However, these findings should be interpreted in consideration of several limitations, including the small sample size, particularly in the severe subgroup, the absence of a control group, and the short, immediate follow-up period. The uneven distribution of participants across severity levels may also limit generalizability. Despite these constraints, the pronounced improvement observed in the severe vocal-fatigue subgroup underscores the clinical relevance of PBM as a rapid, non-invasive option for individuals with substantial phonatory impairment. © 2025.

Kumar P(1), Bhat A(1), Goel D(1), Mittal M(1). Author information: (1)Department of Neurology, Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dehradun, BACKGROUND: This study examines young-onset dementia (YOD). Young-onset dementia refers to cases of dementia that manifest earlier in life and often pose unique clinical and management challenges. Despite its significant impact, data on YOD in northern India remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinico-etiological profile and cognitive characteristics of young-onset dementia patients presenting to a tertiary care center in Uttarakhand, India. METHODS: This is a longitudinal follow-up study that was conducted over 1.5 years in the Department of Neurology. A total of 37 patients under 65 years of age out of 40 selected, diagnosed with major neurocognitive disorder (DSM-5), were included. Comprehensive clinical assessments, brain imaging, and cognitive evaluations were conducted. Data were analyzed using IBM Corp. Released 2018. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 24. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., with chi-square tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Bonferroni corrections, with significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS: The majority of patients were males (65%) and aged 56 to 65 years (50%). Vascular dementia was the most common cause (37.8%), followed by Alzheimer's disease (18.9%) and frontotemporal dementia (13.5%). Based on the verbal-language/orientation-memory (VLOM) ratio, 27.5% had frontotemporal-type dementia and 7.5% had Alzheimer-type dementia. Significant cognitive decline (p < 0.05) in MMSE and ACE-III scores was observed in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Vitamin B12 deficiency showed 13.5% improvement with treatment. VLOM ratios effectively differentiated frontotemporal dementia (FTD) from AD. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that vascular dementia is the leading cause of YOD in this region, reflecting a high burden of modifiable vascular risk factors. The VLOM ratio offers diagnostic value in distinguishing dementia subtypes. Early identification and intervention are essential to address the functional burden of YOD. Copyright © 2025, Kumar et al.

(2)Centre for Sustainable Agricultural Systems, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Darling Downs, QLD 4350, Australia. Bee declines are making headlines, yet awareness of native bees is limited, which may stem in part from poor taxonomic knowledge and under-representation in media and education. This study aimed to determine the Australian public's taxonomic knowledge of native bees and identify the relative popularity of species. We explored this by asking "What is your favourite Australian bee species?" to members joining the Facebook group "The Buzz on Wild Bees". Over nine months, 580 people responded, but only 400 provided an answer of their favourite Australian native bee species, with 419 answers in total (as some provided more than 1 answer). Of these answers, just 12.9% provided a name for a species, rather than a group, and only 7.6% provided a scientific name. The group that emerged as the favourite were the Amegilla ("blue banded" and "teddy bear" bees), followed by the Meliponini ("sugarbag" or "stingless" bees). Euryglossinae, Neopasiphaeinae, and Stenotritidae were absent from the answers. We discuss our results in light of the taxonomic literacy among the public, and hypothesise why certain taxa are more or less popular. Amegilla species could represent a good gateway into raising awareness among the general Australian public about native bees. The selection of region-specific, vulnerable species such as Xylocopa aerata may better serve as flagships. Greater public exposure and education of under-represented Australian native bee taxa is required.

(4)UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, PURPOSE: Providing effective peer feedback plays an important role in collaborative learning and is an essential professional skill for students to develop. This study investigates whether generative AI can improve the quality of peer feedback, and whether it influences students’ perceptions of the feedback received. METHODS: An experimental design was employed involving 129 third-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students. Participants were randomized into two groups: self-generated (SG) feedback and AI-assisted (AI) feedback. The SG group provided feedback independently (i.e., the feedback was crafted on their own, without the use of an AI prompt) using the task, gap, action (TGAP) framework. The AI group utilized generative AI to create feedback based on a given prompt that aligned with the TGAP framework. The prompt was partially completed, requiring students to add behaviors, professional skills (e.g., communication, interpersonal skills), or knowledge related to each student they were evaluating. Feedback was coded and analyzed, and students’ perceptions were measured using the Feedback Perceptions Questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 353 peer feedback comments were analyzed (162 self-generated, 191 AI-assisted). The AI-assisted group achieved significantly higher median scores across all TGAP criteria (Task: H(1) = 27.32, p < 0.001; Gap: H(1) = 89.32, p < 0.001; Action: H(1) = 86.86, p < 0.001). Specifically, 37.0% of students in the SG group compared to 61.3% of students in the AI group provided specific feedback on what their peers did well. For areas of improvement, 13.6% of students in the SG group provided specific areas to improve upon compared to 55.0% of students in the AI group. Only 22.8% of students in the SG provided feedback on how their peers could improve moving forward, compared to 72.8% in AI group. Student perceptions of feedback were positive, with only 3% of the AI group reporting negative feelings about the feedback they received compared to 12.7% in the SG group; this difference was not statistically significant (χ²(1) = 2.97, p = 0.085). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates how the strategic use of AI can be used to improve the quality of peer feedback. Future research should explore the long-term effects of AI-assisted feedback on students’ independent feedback skills and investigate behavioral changes resulting from improved feedback quality.

Hamilton H, Inder M(1). Author information: (1)University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand. INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition where many individuals experience difficulty getting well and staying well with ongoing symptoms and frequent relapses reflecting the limitation of current treatment approaches. Living with bipolar disorder touches every aspect of the individual's life and access to more effective treatments is necessary. The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of receiving a bipolar specific psychological intervention, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy. METHODS: This paper is a first-person narrative that reflects my experience of bipolar disorder including the different treatment approaches and their impact. FINDINGS: This Lived Experience Narrative reflects the significant limitations of medication focused and crisis short-term driven treatment which created an imbalanced approach limiting my ability to achieve significant periods of wellness. Having access to Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy fundamentally changed the approach to managing bipolar disorder. Over time this led to me having an increased sense of control, where bipolar disorder was something to work with rather than an external force controlling life and decisions, resulting in greater periods of wellness and stability. DISCUSSION: This narrative highlights the critical importance of having access to bipolar disorder specific interventions that go beyond medication and acute treatment approaches. Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy provides an understanding and approach that enables the individual with bipolar disorder to implement strategies and tools to more effectively manage their condition and to navigate a meaningful future. © 2025 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common and concerning behavior in adolescents. However, most adolescents cease NSSI as they transition into adulthood. Increased knowledge of the cessation process is needed. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the factors contributing to NSSI cessation in individuals with lived experience of NSSI, providing valuable insights for treatment strategies. METHODS: Twenty-six individuals assigned female sex at birth, between ages 20-22 years, from Sweden were interviewed between 2021 and 2023 in Linköping, Sweden. Of these, 21 individuals perceived themselves as having ceased NSSI and were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis and Hooley and Franklins' Benefits and Barriers Model of NSSI were used to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were generated: "Something inside me changed", "Something in my close relationships changed", and "Something in my life context changed". The cessation of NSSI was associated with several key factors. Improved well-being and envisioning a different future were pivotal in initiating the cessation process. Additionally, interpersonal relationships and support from others were interpreted as powerful motivators for change. Transitioning to a new social context and leaving behind a destructive environment provided opportunities for personal growth and enhanced well-being, interpreted as initiators in the participants' broader life context. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the complexity of the NSSI cessation process and highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors. Access to emotion regulation skills was perceived as a significant barrier to NSSI engagement. Clinical implications and different interventions to support NSSI cessation are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Between 2015 and 2019 the Chronic Headache Education and Self-management Study (CHESS) developed and tested a supportive self-management approach that aimed to improve outcomes for people with chronic migraine or chronic tension type headache with/without episodic migraine. However, a paucity of qualitative research which explored the lived experiences of people with chronic headache was evidenced. In response, we undertook to explore the experiences of living with chronic headaches of people who participated in the CHESS study. METHODS: We adopted qualitative methodologies, inviting participants in the CHESS study to participate in semi-structured interviews. In phase 1 (feasibility study), a thematic analysis was conducted. In phase 2 (main CHESS trial), interviews were informed by topic guides developed from our learning from the phase 1 interviews. Pen portrait methodology and thematic analysis was employed allowing us to explore the data longitudinally. RESULTS: Phase 1, 15 interviews (10 female) age range 29 to 69 years (median 47 years) revealed the complexities of living with chronic headache. Six overarching themes were identified including the emotional impact and the nature of their headaches. Phase 2, included 66 interviews (26 participants; median age group 50s (range 20s-60s); 20 females. 14 were interviewed at three points in time (baseline, 4 and 12 months) Through an iterative process four overlapping categories of headache impact emerged from the data and were agreed: i) 'I will not let headaches rule my life'; ii) 'Headaches rule my life'; iii) 'Headaches out of control-something needs to change'; and iv) 'Headaches controlled-not ruling my life'. One of these categories was assigned to each pen portrait at each timepoint. The remaining 12 participants were interviewed at two time points during a year; pen portraits were again produced. Analysis revealed that the headache impact categories developed above held true in this sample also providing some validation of the categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data give an insight into the complexities of living with chronic headache. Chronic headache is unpredictable, permeating all aspects of an individual's life; even when an individual feels that their headache is controlled and not interfering, this situation can rapidly change. It shows us that more work needs to be done both medically and societally to help people living with this often-hidden condition. © 2024. The Author(s).

Author information: (1)University of Porto Institute of Biomedical Sciences Abel Salazar, Aveiro, Portugal. (2)University of Aveiro, Portugal. (3)University of the Balearic Islands, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain. The process of transitioning involves making changes to align one's life with their authentic gender identity. This study explores the life trajectories of three Portuguese transgender women who transitioned later in life (50+ years old) by identifying key chapters in their life courses. Through inductive thematic analysis, six chapters were identified from the participants' interviews: (1) awareness of "something different in me," (2) locked into suffering, (3) finding comfort in something that is socially recognized, (4) "it is enough": it is time to recognize and embrace the woman I am, (5) living my life as a woman, and (6) building and leaving a legacy. Aging and the process of self-discovery played pivotal roles in participants' process of transitioning. The perception of finitude and the limitations associated with the time of life led them to realize that there was no time to waste and a sense of urgency to live authentically.

(2)Center for Reward and Social Cognition, School of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China. Rewards frequently occur in novel contexts, yet whether novelty facilitates or inhibits reward evaluation remains unclear. Using EEG, we investigated how stimulus novelty affects reward evaluation across two experiments. Participants performed a monetary guessing task where gains and losses were delivered in either novel or familiar forms. In experiment 1 (N = 49), stimulus novelty was integrated into feedback valence as a feedback attribute; in experiment 2 (N = 50), it was separated from feedback valence as a contextual modulator. Time and time-frequency domain results revealed that stimulus novelty reduced reward-related signals when embedded in feedback (experiment 1), regardless of feedback valence. When stimulus novelty acted as a contextual modulator (experiment 2), it selectively attenuated neural responses to gains but not losses. Critically, this gain-specific inhibition diminished as stimulus novelty habituated with task exposure, regardless of novelty's role. Our findings elucidate how stimulus novelty constrains reward evaluation, supporting the novelty inhibition hypothesis. © 2025 The New York Academy of Sciences. DOI: 10.1111/nyas.70182

Written words presented within a sequence of words are identified more accurately when this sequence forms a correct sentence or phrase compared with an ungrammatical re-ordering of the same words. Here we examined if this sentence superiority effect (SSE) is modulated by the predictability of the target word given the sentence context. Target words were at positions 2 and 5 in five-word sequences, and either had high or low cloze probabilities (measured by an independent cloze test and further checked using the word-in-context probabilities obtained with a Large Language Model (LLM)). Given that predictability only made sense when considering grammatically correct sequences, we performed two separate analyses. We found: (1) an effect of grammaticality (i.e., we replicated the SSE), (2) a small effect of predictability on responses to grammatically correct sequences, and (3) no interaction between predictability and grammaticality. The impact of predictability on the SSE was then evaluated by comparing the magnitude of the SSE obtained with more predictable words versus less predictable words, with the SSE in each of these conditions being measured using identification accuracy for the same word at the same position in grammatical and ungrammatical sequences. Results revealed no significant modulation of the SSE by word predictability. We conclude that syntactic and semantic constraints, and not predictability per se (as measured by a cloze test or LLM statistics), contribute to the sentence superiority effect. Crucially, this provides evidence against guessing accounts of the SSE according to which predictability should play a key role. © 2025. The Psychonomic Society, Inc.

Effects of intention understanding and brief imitative experience on the mirror neuron system: An EEG study using Japanese sign language. Osaki T(1), Minamoto T(1). Author information: (1)Faculty of Human Sciences, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan. The mirror neuron system (MNS) is the neural system that activates when individuals both observe and execute an action. Previous studies consistently indicate that the MNS is also involved in intention understanding. In addition, MNS activity is augmented after imitating an unfamiliar action. However, it remains unclear whether conscious effort to interpret an actors' intention further activates the MNS, consequently promoting action learning. To investigate an interactive effect between intention understanding and imitative experience of unfamiliar actions, the present study measured EEG while participants observed Japanese sign language and while they imitated signing. To manipulate a level of intention understanding, we prepared two tasks: the counting task required participants to count the number of body movements in sign language, and the meaning task required participants to guess the meaning of sign language. Mu suppression, one of the indices of the MNS, was measured during three phases: pre-imitation, imitation, and post-imitation. The results revealed that the magnitude of mu suppression was comparable between the two tasks, and remained unchanged in the pre- and post-imitation phases. The null effect of the imitative experience may be attributable to cultural factors as gestural communication is less encouraged in Japanese culture, making it challenging for the MNS to learn new actions. Furthermore, absence of an effect from the task may be attributed to greater number of unfamiliar movements in sign language, resulting in the MNS preferentially processing body movements rather than the intention of actors.

1. Patient Saf Surg. 2025 Dec 16;19(1):36. doi: 10.1186/s13037-025-00456-w. Flawed design and selection bias in critical care randomized controlled trials (RCTs): the patient safety risk of the "RCT mimic". Lynn LA(1). Author information: (1)Doctors Hospital, Ohio Health, Columbus, USA. llynn@lyntekmedical.com. Over three decades, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for critical care syndromes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) have repeatedly produced non-reproducible results, at times leading to high-impact reversals of global protocols when later studies revealed harm. These trials enroll patients using expert-derived threshold sets intended to define the syndrome. This analytic review presents the first historical and formal methodological review and mathematical analysis of such RCT using causal symbolic modeling (cSM), directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and do-calculus. The review includes landmark publications, task-force threshold sets, and case examples, including the 2025 REMAP-CAP corticosteroid domain, to model the causal structure of standard RCTs applied to threshold-defined syndromes. PubMed searches and ChatGPT were used to assist in this process. The historical inquiry uncovered that the critical care syndromes of ARDS and sepsis are guessed synthetic constructs, devised in the twentieth century by Thomas Petty and Roger Bone as heuristic groupings of diverse but similar appearing diseases. However a much more striking discovery was that Petty and Bone introduced a streamlined variant of the Bradford Hill RCT method, here termed the "Petty-Bone RCT', which conditions enrollment on a triage threshold set that functions as a cohort-level collider. This design yields results valid only for the unstable mixture of diseases enrolled. The "Petty-Bone RCT" preserves the outward form of a randomized trial but lacks the causal structure needed for transportability, making it an RCT mimic. The cSM analysis in this review shows that while potentially internally valid, such trials cannot produce reliable treatment protocols and often cause harm. These findings compel the abandonment of the Petty-Bone RCT framework, the integration of cSM into the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT), and prioritizing mechanistically grounded, investigator-led designs in critical care research. These provocative discoveries indicate that not one more patient, not one more investigator, not one more grant should be sacrificed to the next iteration of a Petty and Bone's synthetic syndrome RCT. © 2025.

Ismael MH(1), Maolood AT(1). Author information: (1)Department of computer science, University of Technology Alsina'a Street, 10066, Baghdad, Iraq. In this paper, a medical platform has architecture that depends on middleware and database supports people with Coronavirus, and this platform mainly relies on three users. The first person is the administrator, who is separated into two groups of users: the doctor and the patient. The doctor has an app that questions through the patient so he knows the patient that is being visited and extracts the health identity from him, and he questions the patient for sending him an OTP in the event that the patient does not have a mobile screen or an Internet connection. Alternatively, if QR asks him if his laptop is smart and wired to the Internet, the person will be able to access the system after the doctor has examined them. The patient will examine himself through the devices he has, and the system will provide him with the results of his doctor. The doctor can write a prescription every time he sends new readings. If the prescription is correct, then the patient can keep it and increase the dose. Doctors will work on the prescription console that sends the prescription for cloud authentication and obtain an encrypted QR that will then be issued to the recipient of the drug. The patient has the privilege of studying medication details via the recipient's app. The privilege of viewing QR encrypted cloud data is for life. The drug issuing outlet can decode and issue the drug only as prescribed until the expiration date of the QR. The scheme is designed to promote and provide access to care facilities for both patients and physicians, and it complies with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Gilroy S(1). Author information: (1)Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Birge Hall, 430 Lincoln Drive, Madison, WI 53706, USA. Waves of Ca2+ signals rapidly propagate throughout a plant to help integrate responses to stimuli as diverse as wounding, heat stress, and pathogen attack. In this issue of Science Signaling, Zhang et al. show that bacterial elicitors and physical injury likely use different molecular mechanisms to produce distinct patterns of Ca2+ waves, shedding light on how such a universal signal leads to stimulus-specific responses.

Facilitating Advance Care Planning Conversations Among Patients With Cancer and Their Care Partners Utilizing a Conversation Game: A Pilot Study. Kimbel K(1), Hayes M(1)(2), Bucher M(1), Calo WA(1)(2), Garg T(3), Joshi M(1)(2), Kuntz H(1), Murphy TE(1), VanDyke E(1), Wasserman E(1), Van Scoy Author information: (1)Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA. (2)Penn State Cancer Institute, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA. (3)Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA. BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer should engage in decision-making throughout the course of their illness and treatment. Current guidelines recommend early, frequent advance care planning (ACP) conversations among clinicians, patients, and care partners (CPs) and advance directive (AD) completion. However, only 55% of patients with cancer have completed such directives, suggesting the need for interventions to increase rates of ACP. The Hello game has been shown to be effective in promoting ACP in several populations but has not been tested in patients with cancer or their CP. AIMS: To assess the acceptability of Hello and determine the modifications necessary for use in cancer populations. METHODS AND RESULTS: This convergent mixed methods study involved seven dyads (7 patients with cancer and their 7 CPs to total n = 14); dyads played Hello in groups of 2-4. Post-game, dyads completed satisfaction and acceptability questionnaires and focus groups. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed; quantitative data was summarized. Patients' mean age was 56.4 years-43% were female, 57% had genitourinary cancer, and 43% had breast cancer. Three themes emerged from both patient and CP focus groups (n = 14 individuals): (1) Participants enjoyed the group dynamics and relating to peers when playing Hello; (2) Hello serves as a helpful conversation starter; (3) modifications could help tailor Hello for use in cancer context-particularly adding more questions about quality of life and mental health. The patient focus groups had an additional theme: (4) Patients with localized cancer may have a different experience with Hello when compared to those with advanced cancer. CONCLUSION: Hello was well-received by dyads, and their feedback was used to tailor Hello for patients with cancer and their CPs. Next steps for this project include assessing the acceptability of the modified game. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06028152. © 2025 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: Artificial neural networks have been used in various fields to solve classification and prediction tasks. However, it is unclear if these may be adequate methods to predict psychological treatment outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of neural networks using psychological treatment outcomes data. METHOD: Three neural network models (TensorFlow, nnet, and monmlp) and a generalised linear regression model were compared in their ability to predict post-treatment remission of depression symptoms in a large naturalistic sample (n = 69,489) of patients accessing low intensity cognitive behavioural therapy. Prognostic accuracy was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) in an external cross-validation design. RESULTS: The AUC of the neural networks in an external test sample ranged from 0.64 to 0.65 and the AUC of the linear regression model was 0.63. CONCLUSION: Neural networks can help predict symptom remission in new samples with moderate accuracy, although these models were no more accurate than a simpler inferential statistical linear regression model.

Author information: (1)Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, MSc Public Health (Global Health), King's College London, London, UK. hello@theophiluskwek.com. BACKGROUND: Migrants in Singapore face unique mental health risk factors and barriers to formal care. Within this context, the Migrant Writers of Singapore (an arts collective) has organised a community-based intervention to address mental health needs, the Mental Health Awareness and Well-Being Festival. AIM: To understand migrants' motivations for organising and participating in the Festival as a form of community-based mental health support, as well as their perspectives on the role and effectiveness of such interventions. METHODS: Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted in October and November 2023, with 10 members of MWS involved in the Festival. RESULTS: Interviewees were primarily motivated by personal experiences of giving or receiving peer support, or finding relief through MWS's arts-based activities; and to a smaller extent by the need for greater mental health awareness among migrants. Interviewees saw the value of community-based interventions in: (i) easing loneliness, (ii) establishing solidarity, (iii) facilitating communication in help-seeking, and (iv) building longer-term social networks. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that community-based interventions may be an enabler of peer support, and help address underlying mental health risk factors. Arts-based activities can enhance these interventions, though further research is required to evaluate concrete outcomes, and ascertain the wider applicability of these findings. © 2024.

(2)Predisurge, Grande Usine Creative 2, Saint-Etienne, France. Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly valuable for cardiovascular prediction and simulation, offering critical support for medical decision-making. These models are particularly useful for predicting disease progression and evaluating potential treatments. A major challenge in these models is to preserve the geometric fidelity of meshes while optimizing parameter efficiency to reduce memory usage, computational resources and execution time. In this paper, we present innovative approaches to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) mesh compression, utilizing both statistical and deep learning models, with a focus on unsupervised learning techniques. We explore principal component analysis (PCA) as a statistical method and compare it with several deep learning models, including a simple autoencoder, an enhanced autoencoder based on PCA, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a graph neural network (GNN). Human aortas are compressed using different statistical and deep learning methods to get the most relevant features. The mesh is reconstructed using the computed features and the error of the reconstructed meshes is compared. Our results indicate that PCA, using 64 principal components, outperforms deep learning models with a comparable latent space of 64, achieving the best overall performance. Among the deep learning approaches, the PCA-based autoencoder demonstrates the highest effectiveness. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/cnm.70124 PMID: 41360499 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Independent psychologist, Calvos, Portugal / Rillaar, Belgium. Farina and Schimmenti detail and define the potential consequences for their health when children meet and cannot escape from primary caretakers who neglect, maltreat, and abuse them. They define attachment trauma in this frame and thereby overcome some of the limitations of previous formulations. Inspired by their important work, I try to make a few points. Being ecosystems, we must long and strive to get the useful, to avoid and get rid of the harmful, and to leave alone what is useless. Part of the complexity of our being and becoming is that we include multiple longings and strivings, and that these can be contradictory. Per our very nature, and particularly as children, we long and strive to attach to our primary caretakers, defend against threat, and gain power to act. What to feel, think, and do when caretakers we depend on and must learn from are in fact harmful or useless to us, and the rest of our environment does not care or intervene? What is useful, harmful, and meaningless? Attachment trauma, then, is an ecological injury that evolves when harmful powers of caretakers and others far exceed our own power to act. Being ecosystems, the form the injury takes depends on this reciprocal causing. While it is an injury, it also is a creative effort to live and make sense of a mostd difficult life. © 2025 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.

(12)Department of Environment and Geography, University of York, York, England, BACKGROUND: Child and adolescent mental health is a public health priority, and prevention, early intervention, and treatment are identified as national strategic priorities. Children and young people (CYP) in the United Kingdom are experiencing poorer mental health outcomes than ever, and the demand for services is the highest on record. Understanding the effectiveness of school-based interventions for promoting and developing emotional well-being is a core research priority. A school-based intervention that is inclusive and has the potential for widespread delivery is 'Forest School'. Forest schools provide children with immersive experiences in nature that are non-classroom-based and have a core focus on child-led activities and exploration. Despite widespread implementation, evidence about optimal delivery methods for Forest Schools and their impact on mental health and emotional well-being is scarce. This study will generate new knowledge about the feasibility of running a definitive Forest School trial with Key Stage 2 (KS2) children aged between 7-11 inclusive of children with special educational needs and disabilities. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Is Forest School an acceptable and feasible intervention to improve the mental health of KS2 children?Is it feasible to run a cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of Forest School for children in key stage 2 (aged 7-11)? OBJECTIVES: 1. Test feasibility of trial procedures for recruitment, randomisation, and data collection2. Conduct a mixed methods process evaluation to evaluate implementation and fidelity3. Collect feasibility data to support an economic evaluation in a full trial4. Refine the current logic model and optimise the intervention. METHODS: In Work Package (WP) 1, we will conduct a feasibility cluster RCT of a Forest School intervention with 200 children in five schools across Hull, East Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire. We will test the acceptability and feasibility of intervention delivery, assess the feasibility of the trial processes, and establish key parameters for effectiveness. In WP2, we will evaluate the quality and fidelity of intervention delivery through process evaluation, including observations and qualitative interviews. WP3 focused on the preliminary collection of health economic data. WP4 uses focus groups to refine the logic model and optimize the content of the intervention. We seek to produce a manualised toolkit informed by interconnected work packages to inform further research and implementation. The trial was registered in ISRCTN (The United Kingdom's Trial Registry). Clinical Trials Registration Number ISRCTN87263624. PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: This proposal was developed with the active involvement of parents/guardians, children, and schools alongside key stakeholders from the local authority, education, and the community sector. DISSEMINATION: We will develop accessible presentations, online workshops with interactive elements, and newsletters. Producing a set of easily read infographics and creative outputs (video/social media) alongside our children's Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups will be a key output. We anticipate that two publications in open-access peer-reviewed journals will share the quantitative and qualitative findings of the study. Plain Language Summary: More children and young people than ever are experiencing problems with their mental health. It can be hard for them to get the help they need because waiting times for mental health services are often long. Schools are an important place where children can get support for their wellbeing. One approach that may help is spending more time outdoors and connecting with nature, which has been shown to benefit mental health. Forest School is a type of outdoor learning that involves play, exploration, and hands-on activities in nature. These sessions are becoming more common in schools and community settings. Some people believe Forest School can improve children’s mental health, but we don’t yet have strong evidence to show this. WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT? We want to find out if it’s possible to run a larger study in the future to test whether Forest School can help children's mental health. To do this, we’re running a smaller study first, called a “feasibility trial”. This helps us understand what works and what doesn’t before moving on to a bigger project. WHAT WILL WE DO? We will work with primary schools in England that can run Forest School sessions. The schools will be asked to offer similar types of activities.We will include year groups from Key Stage 2. Some children will be randomly chosen to take part in Forest School for 12 weeks. The other children will continue with their usual school activities during that time. After two terms, the second group will also get the chance to take part in Forest School.We will check:If schools can run the programme as planned.If we can collect the right information about children’s mental health and wellbeing.Whether families and school staff are happy with how the study is run.How much it costs to deliver Forest School.We will also interview children, parents, and staff to understand their experiences. INVOLVING CHILDREN PARENTS AND PROFESSIONALS: Our research team includes people with lived experience. One is a parent of children with additional needs, and another is a Forest School teacher who works with children with special educational needs. We’ve also worked closely with young people from a group called Re-Wilding Youth Hull to help design the study in a way that makes sense to them. SHARING WHAT WE FIND: We will create easy-to-understand summaries of our findings and share them with parents, schools, and mental health professionals. We will also publish the results in academic journals and speak about them at health and education conferences.Throughout the study, we’ll use blogs and social media (like Instagram and Twitter) to keep people updated on our progress.

BACKGROUND: People with multimorbidity work to manage their conditions (burden of treatment). Burden of Treatment Theory (BOTT) proposes poorer outcomes when this work outweighs capacity - an individual's ability to successfully undertake the work of self-management. Capacity is influenced by individual and community factors. This study aims to quantify individual and community capacity factors and explore associations, if any, with mortality and hospitalisation in people with multimorbidity. METHODS: Data source is as follows: West of Scotland Twenty-07 cohort (three age-based cohorts - 15, 35 and 55 years at baseline (wave 1), followed up with four additional waves over 20 years). Participants are as follows: people with ≥ 2 chronic conditions. Variables (e.g. car access/self-esteem/neighbourliness) mapped to underlying individual and community BOTT constructs. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) informed analysis. Cox regression analysis using time-varying covariates explored mortality associations; multiple logistic regression explored hospitalisation associations. Both analyses were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation (SED), alcohol, exercise, fruit/vegetable intake, BMI, smoking, marital status, number of long-term conditions and blood pressure. Exploratory analysis of potential moderating effect of SED was also undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 2249 people had multimorbidity across the five waves (mean age 51.5 (SD 11.6) at baseline and 61 (14.9) at wave 5; male 40.6% baseline, 41.1% wave 5; smokers 32.7% baseline, 25.3% wave 5). Living in social housing was associated with increased mortality (HR (95% CI) 1.39 (1.14, 1.68)), while registered disability was associated with increased risk of hospitalisation (OR (95% CI) 1.7 (1.27, 2.27)). Feeling fearful about walking in the dark was associated with mortality ("try to avoid" OR (95% CI) 0.74 (0.60, 0.92); "feel uncomfortable" (OR (95% CI) 0.70 (0.55, 0.89); "no worries" 0.69 (0.57, 0.83)). Feeling little control over one's life: disagreeing quite a bit with "care from others helps me to get well" OR (95% CI) 0.53 (0.33, 0.86). Initial exploratory analysis suggests high SED could act as a potential moderator, increasing associations between community factors with mortality and hospitalisations. CONCLUSIONS: Individual and community factors influencing capacity to self-manage multimorbidity are quantifiable and associated with adverse health outcomes. Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that capacity issues may be important when designing future multimorbidity interventions and services. © 2025. The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: International economic evaluations have not found convincing evidence that the application of fluoride varnish (FV) in preschool children is a cost-effective anti-caries measure, and there is a lack of economic evaluations of FV in the Brazilian context. AIM: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness (CE) of standard care plus FV for Brazilian preschoolers in the general population, comparing it to standard care in terms of prevention of cavitated caries lesions and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) outcomes. METHODS: Markov models were used, with a 4-year time horizon and 6-month cycles. Transition probabilities were obtained from a national epidemiological survey and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The effectiveness of FV was derived from a systematic review of RCTs. Costs (in Brazilian reais) were sourced from the 2022 National Agency for Supplemental Health dental procedures list. A discount rate of 5% was applied. CE analyses, Markov simulations (MS), and sensitivity analyses (SA) were conducted. Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) used a 95% confidence interval for each variable. For probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), beta distribution curves were used for probabilities, gamma for costs, and lognormal for effectiveness. RESULTS: Standard care plus FV showed an increase in effectiveness (0.01894 and 0.00018 for avoided caries and DALY, respectively) compared to standard care, with an additional cost of R$131.27 per child in the 4-year period. The ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) was calculated at R$6929.09 per cavitated caries lesion prevented and R$727604.84 per DALY avoided. MS revealed little difference in the percentage of individuals in each health state at the end of the simulations. FV prevented cavities in 4 out of every 100 children over a 4-year period, at an average annual cost of R$33 per child (assuming each child who developed cavitated caries lesions had only one). DSA indicated that FV effectiveness was the parameter with the highest potential to influence the ICER. PSA suggested high CE thresholds, from which FV would be considered cost-effective: R$7000 for caries and R$730000 for DALY. CONCLUSION: The total cost of care was lower in the group that invested less in prevention (without FV) compared to the group that invested more (with FV). While it is often said that "more prevention is always better," economic evaluations remind us that not all preventive strategies provide good value for money. © 2025 The Author(s).

Author information: (1)Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Health Sciences, Ankara Bilkent City Hospital Ankara, Türkiye. (2)Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Health, General Directorate of Public Health, Department of Communicable Diseases and Early Warning, Ankara, Türkiye. OBJECTIVE: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease for which colchicine is regularly used every day. Health literacy (HL) is the ability of individuals to acquire, understand and use health information. The aim of this study was to evaluate medication adherence and HL levels in adolescents with FMF and to investigate the impact of HL on colchicine adherence. METHODS: A cross-sectional, prospective study was conducted with FMF patients aged 12-18 years at the Pediatric Rheumatology Department. Medication adherence was measured using the Medication Adherence Scale in FMF Patients, with scores ≥60 indicating adherence. HL was assessed using the Health Literacy Scale for School-Age Children, categorizing scores as low (10-25), moderate (26-35), or high (36-40). RESULTS: Among 87 FMF patients, 53 (60.9%) were female. The mean age of the patients was 14.89 ± 1.69 years. HL levels were moderate in 64 (73.6%), high in 17 (19.5%) and low in 6 (6.9%) patients. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to medication adherence. Nineteen (21.8%) patients were colchicine adherent and 68 (78.2%) were colchicine non-adherent. A significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of HL levels (p < 0.05). None of the patients with low HL were adherent to colchicine treatment. Higher HL levels were associated with increased medication adherence (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between adherent and non-adherent patients in terms of gender, age, educational status, reminder methods, school absenteeism, frequency attacks at the last year, colchicine dose, number of colchicine tablets per day (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Adolescents with FMF were generally found to have moderate levels of HL. Colchicine adherence was found to be higher as HL levels increased. PMID: 41045486 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Erb's Palsy: Visual Diagnosis in Art before Medical History? de Ruiter PEJ(1), Bult SA(1), Dijkstra JR(2), van Gulik TM(1). Author information: (1)Department of Surgery, Amsterdam University Medical Centre (AUMC), Amsterdam, The Netherlands. (2)Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics, Isala Hospital, Zwolle, The Netherlands. BACKGROUND: Close observation is fundamental to both art and medicine, although both disciplines use it in different ways. As doctors need to practice observation of their patients every day, visual arts are increasingly used for the development of observational skills within the medical curriculum. This is particularly useful for students and residents in surgery or in specializations with a surgical component such as gynecology and obstetrics, where close observation of anatomical structures and radiological imaging is essential in providing quality care. Conversely, artists - through close observation - have depicted the world around them for decades. As a result, they might have unintentionally pictured medical abnormalities, before conditions were officially described in the medical world. Several authors have described medical findings in artworks throughout history, such as the visual diagnosis of Erb's palsy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper was to identify and describe depictions of Erb's palsy in art history. METHODS: Authors observed and analyzed several paintings in the Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands on visual medical abnormalities corresponding to obstetrical birth injuries. Additionally, in January 2025 a PubMed search was conducted using the terms "erbs palsy," "birth injuries," "brachial plexus neuropathies," and "art." The paintings of three articles concerning the depiction of Erb's palsy in art were included. A standardized table was constructed in collaboration with medical specialists and used to analyze clinical features of Erb's palsy in the artworks. OUTCOME: PubMed search resulted in three different articles concerning the possible diagnosis of Erb's Palsy in a painting of Albrecht Dürer, i.e., Madonna and Child (ca. 1505). In total, five different paintings from the 16th and 17th century were analyzed regarding the presence of clinical features of Erb's palsy. Three paintings matched six out of seven of the clinical criteria, as stated in the standardized table. Two paintings matched five out of seven clinical criteria of Erb's palsy. It should be noted that the art-historical principles of the so-called Renaissance elbow and the technique of "foreshortening" might have contributed to the depiction of incorrect anatomical features, as a result of artistic freedom rather than the depiction of medical abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: This paper suggests that artists' close observations could possibly have led to depictions of Erb's palsy centuries before the condition was formally described in the medical profession. The findings serve as a reminder that close observation is essential for the work of medical professionals and highlight how art can contribute to training the clinical eye of medical students, residents, and doctors. © 2025 The Author(s).

Alternative Augmentative Communication in paediatric dentistry: a mighty tool to amplify mother tongue's power. Torchia V(1), Tettamanti L(1), Brusamolino F(2), Azzi L(3), Maurino V(1). Author information: (1)Postgraduate School of Paediatric Dentistry, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy. (2)Unit of Paediatric Dentistry, ASST dei Settelaghi, Circolo Hospital, Varese, Italy. (3)Unit of Oral Medicine and Pathology, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy. AIM: The role of a child's mother tongue in shaping his/her identity and emotional development is crucial. In the context of paediatric dentistry, this principle should always be reminded. The child's right to effective communication, even when a language barrier exists, is a fundamental principle, as recently stated in the 'Rights from the Start' rights fact sheet. Preserving a child's native language in the dental setting, especially in the context of an increasingly diverse society with a significant number of refugee children, is essential. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) strategies can assist in bridging language gaps and improving treatment outcomes, blending with the traditional approaches used in paediatric dentistry. The article promotes flexibility, innovation, and empathy in paediatric dentistry to provide optimal care and ensure that every child's rights are respected. CONCLUSION: • The relationship with one's mother language plays a central role in children's growth and in the relationship they can develop with the world, "motherised" by the words of the caregiver. • The interaction between immigrant children from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds and dentists providing their care requires the integration of traditional paediatric dental techniques with AAC strategies that can compensate for deficient oral communication. • Dentists treating immigrant children should follow the suggestions proposed in this article to establish the best and most tailored paediatric setting for the child's specific needs.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience

I don't know if I could ever get used to the taste. It just feels like something is missing from my mouth when I take a bite.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative

The task is to decide whether the provided abstracts collectively SUPPORT, REFUTE, or leave UNCERTAIN the claim. 

CLAIM:
This study assessed the relationship between BMI and sleep duration in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In particular, we examined the effect of BMI on sleep parameters using polysomnography (PSG) data collected during PSG-based treatment. This is a retrospective analysis of 150 children with OSA between the ages of 3 and 8 years who underwent PSG as part of their evaluation for suspected OSA. All patients completed an overnight PSG study, including measurement of BMI percentile (BMIP) during diagnosis or treatment. The relationship between BMI and sleep duration was analyzed using linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, and race.

EVIDENCE:
In this retrospective analysis of 150 children with OSA who underwent overnight PSG evaluation for suspected OSA, we found a strong inverse relationship between BMI percentile (BMIP) and total sleep time (TST), with the greatest impact being observed in patients with normal BMIP. Specifically, we found that each 1-point increase in BMIP was associated with an average decrease of approximately 5 minutes in TST. This finding highlights the importance of addressing overweight and obesity as a potential contributor to OSA severity in children.

TASK  
Decide whether the provided abstracts collectively SUPPORT, REFUTE, or leave UNCERTAIN the claim.

CLAIM:
"If you find out that your child has been exposed to lead poisoning, get medical help immediately."

EVIDENCE:
A 2015 study found 43 percent of children aged 6 months to 6 years in China had levels of arsenic and lead in their blood that exceed WHO guidelines. "A high level of lead exposure was associated with an increase in the risk of poor psychomotor development," says Xue-Qi Li, the study's lead researcher at Fudan University School of Public Health in Shanghai.

A 2014 study found 78 percent of children aged 6 months to 3 years in China had levels of arsenic and cadmium in their blood that exceed WHO guidelines. "Levels of heavy metals were associated with the risk for poor psychomotor development and altered immune function," says Jing Chen, study lead researcher at Shanghai Children's Medical Center.

A 2015 study found 37 percent of children aged 6 months to 6 years in China had levels of arsenic and cadmium in their blood that exceed WHO guidelines. "Levels of heavy metal were associated with the risk for poor psychomotor development, altered immune function and kidney damage," says Jing Chen, study lead researcher at Shanghai Children's Medical Center.

{'transcript': "Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other.

In particular, we examined the effect of BMI on sleep parameters using polysomnography (PSG) data collected during PSG-based treatment. This is a retrospective analysis of 150 children with OSA between the ages of 3 and 8 years who underwent PSG as part of their evaluation for suspected OSA. All patients completed an overnight PSG study, including measurement of BMI percentile (BMIP) during diagnosis or treatment. The relationship between BMI and sleep duration was analyzed using linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, and race.\n\nEVIDENCE:\nIn this retrospective analysis of 150 children with OSA who underwent overnight PSG evaluation for suspected OSA, we found a strong inverse relationship between BMI percentile (BMIP) and total sleep time (TST), with the greatest impact being observed in patients with normal BMIP. Specifically, we found that each 1-point increase in BMIP was associated with an average decrease of approximately 5 minutes in TST. This finding highlights the importance of addressing overweight and obesity as a potential contributor to OSA severity in children.\n\nHOLD OUT:  \nPlease, do not use any of the following resources (including Google or Wikipedia) when formulating your answer!', 'confidence': 0.0, 'query': "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.
