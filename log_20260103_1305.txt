Prepromt STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app. You get a claim about health or medicine extracted from a instragram video transcript.
**Think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

Whey protein hydrolysates, the industrial byproducts from the dairy industry, contains various bioactive peptides. When added to infant formula, it may potentially enhance the bioactive potential of the infant formula milk. This study incorporated whey protein hydrolysates into an existing milk powder formula C, creating a new formula H. The feasibility of this addition was assessed by comparing the bioactive peptides in whey protein hydrolysates, formula C, and formula H before and after simulated digestion. The experiment included peptidomic analysis of the three samples(whey hydrolyzed protein, formula C and formula H). Mass spectrometry identified 126 bioactive peptides, including sleep-inducing, immune-modulatory, antimicrobial, and neuropeptides. Molecular docking and computer simulations revealed that the peptides bind primarily to their receptors via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This study, which integrates experimental findings with bioinformatics analysis, highlights the potential applications of whey protein hydrolysates in infant formula milk, providing a theoretical foundation for future high value-added dairy product development.

Quantity and Quality of Dairy Product Intake and Their Relationship with Body Composition in Children and Adolescents from Mexico City. Partida-Gaytan A(1), Montiel-Ojeda D(2)(3), Clark P(2)(3), Lopez-Gonzalez Author information: (1)Clinical Research Direction, Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico. (2)Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico. (3)Clinical Epidemiology Research Unit, Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico. Background: The association between milk-derived or dairy product intake (DPI) and the body composition (BC) of children and adolescents continues to be controversial. Objective: This study sought to evaluate the association between the quantity and quality of DPI and the BC of Mexican children and adolescents. Methods: A secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional population-based sample of 2104 children and adolescents (aged 4-18 years) recruited from schools in Mexico City was performed. To assess the association between the quantity and quality of DPI, evaluated by questionnaire, and BC, dual X-ray densitometry (DXA) and surrogate parameters of the fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass index (LMI) were used. The adequacy of the quantity and quality of DPI was classified according to age-specific recommendations and the sugar, sodium and fat contents of the products consumed. Relationships were assessed by means of lineal regressions adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, sleep time and screen hours. Results: We included a total of 1840 participants aged 4.5-18 years, 52% of whom were female. Average daily DPI was 4.0 ± 2.4 servings/day, with a predominance of milk without sugar (42.7% of DPI). The quantity and quality of DPI significantly reduced the FMI (beta = -0.1 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06, p < 0.001 and beta = -0.17 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.07, p < 0.001). No significant relationships were seen with the LMI. Conclusions: Higher quantities of good-quality DPI are associated with lower adiposity in Mexican children and adolescents.

Background/Objectives: Overweight and obesity (OW/OB) in immigrant children is a complex multifactorial issue. This work aims to present the OW/OB profile and lifestyle habits of immigrant children and compare them with their native counterparts. Methods: A cross-sectional study (ASOMAD) was conducted in a representative sample of children aged 8-12 years in Madrid from 2020 to 2023. Parental origin, physical activity (PA), screen time, adherence to Mediterranean Diet, sleep, and body composition were assessed by validated methods. OW/OB was determined according to IOTF guidelines. T-tests, chi-square tests, and two-way ANOVA tests were applied based on the variables' characteristics. Results: A total of 587 children (54% boys, aged 9.54 ± 1.19 y), 33.2% immigrants, were studied. OW/OB rate was higher in immigrants (39.7% boys and 37.4% girls) than in natives (18.0% boys and 17.7% girls) (p < 0.05). Immigrant boys were 30.64 ± 8.39 min/day less active than natives (p < 0.001). Both male and female immigrant children devoted considerably more weekday hours to screen time than natives (2.76 ± 2.75; 2.02 ± 2.47 vs. 2.09 ± 2.29; 1.32 ± 1.38; p < 0.05, respectively). Immigrant children consumed significantly less fish and olive oil and more pasta or rice almost every day (5 or more/week), ate at fast-food restaurants, consumed fewer dairy products and baked goods or pastries for breakfast (p < 0.05), and exhibited worse diet quality compared to Spanish ones. Conclusions: Immigrant children exhibited a higher prevalence of OW/OB, higher screen time, lower PA time, and ate less fish and olive oil and more pasta than natives. Additional research is required to explore the causes of these issues and enhance the lifestyle within this group.

(5)Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA; University of California San Diego, Department of Psychiatry, San Diego, California, USA. OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests a role of diet in sleep disturbances and mental health including internalizing (e.g., anxiety, depression) and externalizing (e.g., aggression, impulsivity) problems. METHODS: This study employed a data-driven approach to construct a Sleep-Mental Health-Eating Index and assessed its mediating roles in the relationships between difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems in 11,000 youth aged 9-10years. Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems were assessed annually from baseline to Year2, and diet at Year1. The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was used to derive the eating index. RESULTS: Six dietary categories emerged as important predictors of our outcomes, with whole grains, green vegetables, and berries linked to lower difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep scores, while sweet pastries, fast food, and butter cream linked to higher difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. Dietary factors explained 2.24% of difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep variation, surpassing demographics (1.21%). For internalizing behaviors, dietary and demographic contributions were similar (1.86% vs. 1.98%). Demographics were the strongest predictors of externalizing symptoms (3.84%). Higher baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (beta = -0.026, 95% CI: -0.038, -0.015) and internalizing scores (beta = -0.027, 95% CI: -0.035, -0.019) were associated with worse eating index at Year1. Additionally, the eating index mediated relationships between baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep/internalizing problems and Year2 outcomes. Overall, indirect effects range from 3.2% to 7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight diet's role in predicting and mediating sleep and mental health outcomes. Healthy foods were associated with fewer sleep difficulties and internalizing problems, while unhealthy foods worsen sleep and behavior problems. Targeting diet may improve interventions addressing adolescent sleep and mental health challenges. Copyright © 2025 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

(3)Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China. (4)School of Nursing, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China. Objectives: The present study evaluated anthropometry Z-scores of exclusively breastfed infants aged 0~6 months and examined their associations with various parent-infant factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 383 mother-infant dyads from 10 Chinese cities in the final analyses, under strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were collected by trained investigators using questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, perinatal health, maternal and infant factors during lactation. Nutrient intake was assessed and calculated by 24 h recall. Anthropometric measurements of parents and infants were taken using calibrated instruments, with infant growth assessed via Chinese growth standards. Statistical analyses included correlation and linear mixed-effect models accounting for regional clustering, with variable selection guided by backward elimination step regression. Nonlinear relationships were explored using spline and piecewise regression methods. Results: Over 60% of the mothers had inadequate energy and protein intake. Approximately two-thirds of the participants had fat intakes exceeding the upper limit. Inadequate or excessive gestational weight gain, poor maternal sleep quality, lactational mastitis, higher maternal fat intake and infant gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with lower infant anthropometry Z-scores. A threshold effect was detected between maternal fat intake and infant WAZ, BMI Z, and WLZ. Conclusions: This study found that anthropometry Z-scores of exclusively breastfed infants aged 0-6 months were significantly associated with certain maternal-infant factors and maternal fat intake, emphasizing the need for early intervention on adverse factors and balanced maternal diet nutrition during lactation.

 Evidence Summary: 1. Nurse Pract. 1993 Sep;18(9):25-9. A comparison of self-reported self-care practices of pregnant adolescents. Lee SH(1), Grubbs LM. Author information: (1)School of Nursing, Florida State University (FSU), Tallahassee. Recent research has suggested that effective prenatal care is significantly related to positive outcomes for the teen mother and her infant. One aspect of prenatal care is the efforts of the pregnant teen to care for herself, often called self-care practices. The purpose of this article is to compare the self-reported self-care activities of pregnant teenagers who sought prenatal care during the first trimester of their pregnancies with those of pregnant teens who delayed prenatal care until the third trimester. The subjects were adolescent girls who were enrolled in prenatal care programs or who had recently delivered in Florida. Interview analysis suggested that both groups had an adequate knowledge level regarding diet, exercise, and other topics related to self-care during pregnancy. Although pregnant teens practice similar self-care behaviors regardless of when they enter prenatal care, there are many problems that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes and can remain undetected when prenatal care is delayed. PIP: Nurse practitioners interviewed 48 adolescents who were either pregnant or had just delivered to learn how they cared for themselves. The teens were attending or had attended prenatal clinics in Florida. They were divided into 2 groups: 34 teens who began prenatal care in the 1st trimester and 12 teens who did in the 3rd trimester. 73% of teens in the early group considered prenatal care as a self-care activity, while just 1 in the late group did. All but 1 teen practiced self-care throughout the pregnancy, sometimes before formally entering prenatal care. 94.1% in the early group and 83.3% in the late group reported that family members helped with self-care. Some nutrition self-care activities were increased intake of milk and vegetables and a decrease of elimination of fatty foods and caffeine. 97% in the early group and 75% in the late group enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children program. 54% in the early group and 41% in the late group used vitamin and mineral supplements. 67.6% in early group and 75% in late group either continued or began to exercise during pregnancy. 35.2% in the early group and 41.6% in the late group took more time to sleep and rest. Even though some teens abused substances before pregnancy, they all reported no drug or alcohol use during pregnancy. 3 early-group teens and 1 late-group teen still smokes cigarettes, even though they knew it was unhealthy for the baby. Most teens avoided strenuous activities, e.g., team sports. Even though the teens practiced self-care, delay of prenatal care can still lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. An increased need exists for health education or self-care in public schools and during routine preventive health care, mass media campaigns on pregnancy signs and symptoms and early prenatal care, and support from parents and other family members.

DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross sectional study was based on data of the 1987-1988 Dutch national food consumption survey (DNFCS), obtained from a panel by a stratified probability sample of the non-institutionalised Dutch population. PARTICIPANTS: 3781 adults (1802 males and 1979 females) of the DNFCS, aged 19 to 85 years, were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To estimate dietary intake two day food records were used. Lifestyle factors were collected by structured questionnaire and sociodemographic variables were available from panel information. Cluster analysis was used to classify subjects into groups based on similarities in dietary variables. Subsequently, these groups were characterised by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as by the consumption of food groups. Eight clusters were found. In comparison with the guidelines, the dietary quality in four clusters was poor. The cluster with the poorest dietary intake (high intake of fat, cholesterol, and alcohol; low intake of dietary fibre) showed on average a high consumption of animal products (except milk), fats and oils, snacks, and alcoholic beverages, and a low consumption of fruit, potatoes, vegetables, and sugar rich products. Smoking, body mass index, dietary regimen on own initiative, hours of sleep, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and day of the week were found to discriminate among the clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analysis resulted in substantial differences in mean nutrient intake and seems useful for dietary risk group identification. Undesirable lifestyle habits were interrelated in some clusters, but an exclusive lifestyle for health risk has not been found. DOI: 10.1136/jech.46.4.417 PMID: 1431719 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Whey protein hydrolysates, the industrial byproducts from the dairy industry, contains various bioactive peptides. When added to infant formula, it may potentially enhance the bioactive potential of the infant formula milk. This study incorporated whey protein hydrolysates into an existing milk powder formula C, creating a new formula H. The feasibility of this addition was assessed by comparing the bioactive peptides in whey protein hydrolysates, formula C, and formula H before and after simulated digestion. The experiment included peptidomic analysis of the three samples(whey hydrolyzed protein, formula C and formula H). Mass spectrometry identified 126 bioactive peptides, including sleep-inducing, immune-modulatory, antimicrobial, and neuropeptides. Molecular docking and computer simulations revealed that the peptides bind primarily to their receptors via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This study, which integrates experimental findings with bioinformatics analysis, highlights the potential applications of whey protein hydrolysates in infant formula milk, providing a theoretical foundation for future high value-added dairy product development.

(2)Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City 04510, Mexico. (3)Clinical Epidemiology Research Unit, Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez, Mexico City 06720, Mexico. Background: The association between milk-derived or dairy product intake (DPI) and the body composition (BC) of children and adolescents continues to be controversial. Objective: This study sought to evaluate the association between the quantity and quality of DPI and the BC of Mexican children and adolescents. Methods: A secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional population-based sample of 2104 children and adolescents (aged 4-18 years) recruited from schools in Mexico City was performed. To assess the association between the quantity and quality of DPI, evaluated by questionnaire, and BC, dual X-ray densitometry (DXA) and surrogate parameters of the fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass index (LMI) were used. The adequacy of the quantity and quality of DPI was classified according to age-specific recommendations and the sugar, sodium and fat contents of the products consumed. Relationships were assessed by means of lineal regressions adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, sleep time and screen hours. Results: We included a total of 1840 participants aged 4.5-18 years, 52% of whom were female. Average daily DPI was 4.0 ± 2.4 servings/day, with a predominance of milk without sugar (42.7% of DPI). The quantity and quality of DPI significantly reduced the FMI (beta = -0.1 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06, p < 0.001 and beta = -0.17 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.07, p < 0.001). No significant relationships were seen with the LMI. Conclusions: Higher quantities of good-quality DPI are associated with lower adiposity in Mexican children and adolescents.

Background/Objectives: Overweight and obesity (OW/OB) in immigrant children is a complex multifactorial issue. This work aims to present the OW/OB profile and lifestyle habits of immigrant children and compare them with their native counterparts. Methods: A cross-sectional study (ASOMAD) was conducted in a representative sample of children aged 8-12 years in Madrid from 2020 to 2023. Parental origin, physical activity (PA), screen time, adherence to Mediterranean Diet, sleep, and body composition were assessed by validated methods. OW/OB was determined according to IOTF guidelines. T-tests, chi-square tests, and two-way ANOVA tests were applied based on the variables' characteristics. Results: A total of 587 children (54% boys, aged 9.54 ± 1.19 y), 33.2% immigrants, were studied. OW/OB rate was higher in immigrants (39.7% boys and 37.4% girls) than in natives (18.0% boys and 17.7% girls) (p < 0.05). Immigrant boys were 30.64 ± 8.39 min/day less active than natives (p < 0.001). Both male and female immigrant children devoted considerably more weekday hours to screen time than natives (2.76 ± 2.75; 2.02 ± 2.47 vs. 2.09 ± 2.29; 1.32 ± 1.38; p < 0.05, respectively). Immigrant children consumed significantly less fish and olive oil and more pasta or rice almost every day (5 or more/week), ate at fast-food restaurants, consumed fewer dairy products and baked goods or pastries for breakfast (p < 0.05), and exhibited worse diet quality compared to Spanish ones. Conclusions: Immigrant children exhibited a higher prevalence of OW/OB, higher screen time, lower PA time, and ate less fish and olive oil and more pasta than natives. Additional research is required to explore the causes of these issues and enhance the lifestyle within this group.

(5)Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA; University of California San Diego, Department of Psychiatry, San Diego, California, USA. OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests a role of diet in sleep disturbances and mental health including internalizing (e.g., anxiety, depression) and externalizing (e.g., aggression, impulsivity) problems. METHODS: This study employed a data-driven approach to construct a Sleep-Mental Health-Eating Index and assessed its mediating roles in the relationships between difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems in 11,000 youth aged 9-10years. Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems were assessed annually from baseline to Year2, and diet at Year1. The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was used to derive the eating index. RESULTS: Six dietary categories emerged as important predictors of our outcomes, with whole grains, green vegetables, and berries linked to lower difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep scores, while sweet pastries, fast food, and butter cream linked to higher difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. Dietary factors explained 2.24% of difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep variation, surpassing demographics (1.21%). For internalizing behaviors, dietary and demographic contributions were similar (1.86% vs. 1.98%). Demographics were the strongest predictors of externalizing symptoms (3.84%). Higher baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (beta = -0.026, 95% CI: -0.038, -0.015) and internalizing scores (beta = -0.027, 95% CI: -0.035, -0.019) were associated with worse eating index at Year1. Additionally, the eating index mediated relationships between baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep/internalizing problems and Year2 outcomes. Overall, indirect effects range from 3.2% to 7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight diet's role in predicting and mediating sleep and mental health outcomes. Healthy foods were associated with fewer sleep difficulties and internalizing problems, while unhealthy foods worsen sleep and behavior problems. Targeting diet may improve interventions addressing adolescent sleep and mental health challenges. Copyright © 2025 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

(3)Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China. (4)School of Nursing, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China. Objectives: The present study evaluated anthropometry Z-scores of exclusively breastfed infants aged 0~6 months and examined their associations with various parent-infant factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 383 mother-infant dyads from 10 Chinese cities in the final analyses, under strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were collected by trained investigators using questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, perinatal health, maternal and infant factors during lactation. Nutrient intake was assessed and calculated by 24 h recall. Anthropometric measurements of parents and infants were taken using calibrated instruments, with infant growth assessed via Chinese growth standards. Statistical analyses included correlation and linear mixed-effect models accounting for regional clustering, with variable selection guided by backward elimination step regression. Nonlinear relationships were explored using spline and piecewise regression methods. Results: Over 60% of the mothers had inadequate energy and protein intake. Approximately two-thirds of the participants had fat intakes exceeding the upper limit. Inadequate or excessive gestational weight gain, poor maternal sleep quality, lactational mastitis, higher maternal fat intake and infant gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with lower infant anthropometry Z-scores. A threshold effect was detected between maternal fat intake and infant WAZ, BMI Z, and WLZ. Conclusions: This study found that anthropometry Z-scores of exclusively breastfed infants aged 0-6 months were significantly associated with certain maternal-infant factors and maternal fat intake, emphasizing the need for early intervention on adverse factors and balanced maternal diet nutrition during lactation.

Evidence: 1. Nurse Pract. 1993 Sep;18(9):25-9. A comparison of self-reported self-care practices of pregnant adolescents. Lee SH(1), Grubbs LM. Author information: (1)School of Nursing, Florida State University (FSU), Tallahassee. Recent research has suggested that effective prenatal care is significantly related to positive outcomes for the teen mother and her infant. One aspect of prenatal care is the efforts of the pregnant teen to care for herself, often called self-care practices. The purpose of this article is to compare the self-reported self-care activities of pregnant teenagers who sought prenatal care during the first trimester of their pregnancies with those of pregnant teens who delayed prenatal care until the third trimester. The subjects were adolescent girls who were enrolled in prenatal care programs or who had recently delivered in Florida. Interview analysis suggested that both groups had an adequate knowledge level regarding diet, exercise, and other topics related to self-care during pregnancy. Although pregnant teens practice similar self-care behaviors regardless of when they enter prenatal care, there are many problems that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes and can remain undetected when prenatal care is delayed. PIP: Nurse practitioners interviewed 48 adolescents who were either pregnant or had just delivered to learn how they cared for themselves. The teens were attending or had attended prenatal clinics in Florida. They were divided into 2 groups: 34 teens who began prenatal care in the 1st trimester and 12 teens who did in the 3rd trimester. 73% of teens in the early group considered prenatal care as a self-care activity, while just 1 in the late group did. All but 1 teen practiced self-care throughout the pregnancy, sometimes before formally entering prenatal care. 94.1% in the early group and 83.3% in the late group reported that family members helped with self-care. Some nutrition self-care activities were increased intake of milk and vegetables and a decrease of elimination of fatty foods and caffeine. 97% in the early group and 75% in the late group enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children program. 54% in the early group and 41% in the late group used vitamin and mineral supplements. 67.6% in early group and 75% in late group either continued or began to exercise during pregnancy. 35.2% in the early group and 41.6% in the late group took more time to sleep and rest. Even though some teens abused substances before pregnancy, they all reported no drug or alcohol use during pregnancy. 3 early-group teens and 1 late-group teen still smokes cigarettes, even though they knew it was unhealthy for the baby. Most teens avoided strenuous activities, e.g., team sports. Even though the teens practiced self-care, delay of prenatal care can still lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. An increased need exists for health education or self-care in public schools and during routine preventive health care, mass media campaigns on pregnancy signs and symptoms and early prenatal care, and support from parents and other family members.

Hulshof KF(1), Wedel M, Löwik MR, Kok FJ, Kistemaker C, Hermus RJ, ten Hoor F, Ockhuizen T. Author information: (1)Department of Human Nutrition, TNO Toxicology and Nutrition Institute, Ziest, The Netherlands. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate whether dietary factors cluster in a favourable or unfavourable way and to characterise the groups identified by lifestyle and sociodemographic variables. DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross sectional study was based on data of the 1987-1988 Dutch national food consumption survey (DNFCS), obtained from a panel by a stratified probability sample of the non-institutionalised Dutch population. PARTICIPANTS: 3781 adults (1802 males and 1979 females) of the DNFCS, aged 19 to 85 years, were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To estimate dietary intake two day food records were used. Lifestyle factors were collected by structured questionnaire and sociodemographic variables were available from panel information. Cluster analysis was used to classify subjects into groups based on similarities in dietary variables. Subsequently, these groups were characterised by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as by the consumption of food groups. Eight clusters were found. In comparison with the guidelines, the dietary quality in four clusters was poor. The cluster with the poorest dietary intake (high intake of fat, cholesterol, and alcohol; low intake of dietary fibre) showed on average a high consumption of animal products (except milk), fats and oils, snacks, and alcoholic beverages, and a low consumption of fruit, potatoes, vegetables, and sugar rich products. Smoking, body mass index, dietary regimen on own initiative, hours of sleep, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and day of the week were found to discriminate among the clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analysis resulted in substantial differences in mean nutrient intake and seems useful for dietary risk group identification. Undesirable lifestyle habits were interrelated in some clusters, but an exclusive lifestyle for health risk has not been found. DOI: 10.1136/jech.46.4.417 PMID: 1431719 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Objectives: The present study evaluated anthropometry Z-scores of exclusively breastfed infants aged 0~6 months and examined their associations with various parent-infant factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 383 mother-infant dyads from 10 Chinese cities in the final analyses, under strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were collected by trained investigators using questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, perinatal health, maternal and infant factors during lactation. Nutrient intake was assessed and calculated by 24 h recall. Anthropometric measurements of parents and infants were taken using calibrated instruments, with infant growth assessed via Chinese growth standards. Statistical analyses included correlation and linear mixed-effect models accounting for regional clustering, with variable selection guided by backward elimination step regression. Nonlinear relationships were explored using spline and piecewise regression methods. Results: Over 60% of the mothers had inadequate energy and protein intake. Approximately two-thirds of the participants had fat intakes exceeding the upper limit. Inadequate or excessive gestational weight gain, poor maternal sleep quality, lactational mastitis, higher maternal fat intake and infant gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with lower infant anthropometry Z-scores. A threshold effect was detected between maternal fat intake and infant WAZ, BMI Z, and WLZ. Conclusions: This study found that anthropometry Z-scores of exclusively breastfed infants aged 0-6 months were significantly associated with certain maternal-infant factors and maternal fat intake, emphasizing the need for early intervention on adverse factors and balanced maternal diet nutrition during lactation.

Author information: (1)School of Nursing, Florida State University (FSU), Tallahassee. Recent research has suggested that effective prenatal care is significantly related to positive outcomes for the teen mother and her infant. One aspect of prenatal care is the efforts of the pregnant teen to care for herself, often called self-care practices. The purpose of this article is to compare the self-reported self-care activities of pregnant teenagers who sought prenatal care during the first trimester of their pregnancies with those of pregnant teens who delayed prenatal care until the third trimester. The subjects were adolescent girls who were enrolled in prenatal care programs or who had recently delivered in Florida. Interview analysis suggested that both groups had an adequate knowledge level regarding diet, exercise, and other topics related to self-care during pregnancy. Although pregnant teens practice similar self-care behaviors regardless of when they enter prenatal care, there are many problems that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes and can remain undetected when prenatal care is delayed. PIP: Nurse practitioners interviewed 48 adolescents who were either pregnant or had just delivered to learn how they cared for themselves. The teens were attending or had attended prenatal clinics in Florida. They were divided into 2 groups: 34 teens who began prenatal care in the 1st trimester and 12 teens who did in the 3rd trimester. 73% of teens in the early group considered prenatal care as a self-care activity, while just 1 in the late group did. All but 1 teen practiced self-care throughout the pregnancy, sometimes before formally entering prenatal care. 94.1% in the early group and 83.3% in the late group reported that family members helped with self-care. Some nutrition self-care activities were increased intake of milk and vegetables and a decrease of elimination of fatty foods and caffeine. 97% in the early group and 75% in the late group enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children program. 54% in the early group and 41% in the late group used vitamin and mineral supplements. 67.6% in early group and 75% in late group either continued or began to exercise during pregnancy. 35.2% in the early group and 41.6% in the late group took more time to sleep and rest.

{'transcript': "Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else.

Whey protein hydrolysates, the industrial byproducts from the dairy industry, contains various bioactive peptides. When added to infant formula, it may potentially enhance the bioactive potential of the infant formula milk. This study incorporated whey protein hydrolysates into an existing milk powder formula C, creating a new formula H. The feasibility of this addition was assessed by comparing the bioactive peptides in whey protein hydrolysates, formula C, and formula H before and after simulated digestion. The experiment included peptidomic analysis of the three samples(whey hydrolyzed protein, formula C and formula H). Mass spectrometry identified 126 bioactive peptides, including sleep-inducing, immune-modulatory, antimicrobial, and neuropeptides. Molecular docking and computer simulations revealed that the peptides bind primarily to their receptors via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. This study, which integrates experimental findings with bioinformatics analysis, highlights the potential applications of whey protein hydrolysates in infant formula milk, providing a theoretical foundation for future high value-added dairy product development.

Background: The association between milk-derived or dairy product intake (DPI) and the body composition (BC) of children and adolescents continues to be controversial. Objective: This study sought to evaluate the association between the quantity and quality of DPI and the BC of Mexican children and adolescents. Methods: A secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional population-based sample of 2104 children and adolescents (aged 4-18 years) recruited from schools in Mexico City was performed. To assess the association between the quantity and quality of DPI, evaluated by questionnaire, and BC, dual X-ray densitometry (DXA) and surrogate parameters of the fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass index (LMI) were used. The adequacy of the quantity and quality of DPI was classified according to age-specific recommendations and the sugar, sodium and fat contents of the products consumed. Relationships were assessed by means of lineal regressions adjusted for age, sex, physical activity, sleep time and screen hours. Results: We included a total of 1840 participants aged 4.5-18 years, 52% of whom were female. Average daily DPI was 4.0 ± 2.4 servings/day, with a predominance of milk without sugar (42.7% of DPI). The quantity and quality of DPI significantly reduced the FMI (beta = -0.1 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.06, p < 0.001 and beta = -0.17 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.07, p < 0.001). No significant relationships were seen with the LMI. Conclusions: Higher quantities of good-quality DPI are associated with lower adiposity in Mexican children and adolescents.

Background/Objectives: Overweight and obesity (OW/OB) in immigrant children is a complex multifactorial issue. This work aims to present the OW/OB profile and lifestyle habits of immigrant children and compare them with their native counterparts. Methods: A cross-sectional study (ASOMAD) was conducted in a representative sample of children aged 8-12 years in Madrid from 2020 to 2023. Parental origin, physical activity (PA), screen time, adherence to Mediterranean Diet, sleep, and body composition were assessed by validated methods. OW/OB was determined according to IOTF guidelines. T-tests, chi-square tests, and two-way ANOVA tests were applied based on the variables' characteristics. Results: A total of 587 children (54% boys, aged 9.54 ± 1.19 y), 33.2% immigrants, were studied. OW/OB rate was higher in immigrants (39.7% boys and 37.4% girls) than in natives (18.0% boys and 17.7% girls) (p < 0.05). Immigrant boys were 30.64 ± 8.39 min/day less active than natives (p < 0.001). Both male and female immigrant children devoted considerably more weekday hours to screen time than natives (2.76 ± 2.75; 2.02 ± 2.47 vs. 2.09 ± 2.29; 1.32 ± 1.38; p < 0.05, respectively). Immigrant children consumed significantly less fish and olive oil and more pasta or rice almost every day (5 or more/week), ate at fast-food restaurants, consumed fewer dairy products and baked goods or pastries for breakfast (p < 0.05), and exhibited worse diet quality compared to Spanish ones. Conclusions: Immigrant children exhibited a higher prevalence of OW/OB, higher screen time, lower PA time, and ate less fish and olive oil and more pasta than natives. Additional research is required to explore the causes of these issues and enhance the lifestyle within this group.

OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests a role of diet in sleep disturbances and mental health including internalizing (e.g., anxiety, depression) and externalizing (e.g., aggression, impulsivity) problems. METHODS: This study employed a data-driven approach to construct a Sleep-Mental Health-Eating Index and assessed its mediating roles in the relationships between difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems in 11,000 youth aged 9-10years. Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and mental health problems were assessed annually from baseline to Year2, and diet at Year1. The Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was used to derive the eating index. RESULTS: Six dietary categories emerged as important predictors of our outcomes, with whole grains, green vegetables, and berries linked to lower difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep scores, while sweet pastries, fast food, and butter cream linked to higher difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. Dietary factors explained 2.24% of difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep variation, surpassing demographics (1.21%). For internalizing behaviors, dietary and demographic contributions were similar (1.86% vs. 1.98%). Demographics were the strongest predictors of externalizing symptoms (3.84%). Higher baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (beta = -0.026, 95% CI: -0.038, -0.015) and internalizing scores (beta = -0.027, 95% CI: -0.035, -0.019) were associated with worse eating index at Year1. Additionally, the eating index mediated relationships between baseline difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep/internalizing problems and Year2 outcomes. Overall, indirect effects range from 3.2% to 7.0%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight diet's role in predicting and mediating sleep and mental health outcomes. Healthy foods were associated with fewer sleep difficulties and internalizing problems, while unhealthy foods worsen sleep and behavior problems. Targeting diet may improve interventions addressing adolescent sleep and mental health challenges. Copyright © 2025 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Conclusions: This study found that anthropometry Z-scores of exclusively breastfed infants aged 0-6 months were significantly associated with certain maternal-infant factors and maternal fat intake, emphasizing the need for early intervention on adverse factors and balanced maternal diet nutrition during lactation.

Nurse Pract. 1993 Sep;18(9):25-9. A comparison of self-reported self-care practices of pregnant adolescents. Lee SH(1), Grubbs LM. Author information: (1)School of Nursing, Florida State University (FSU), Tallahassee. Recent research has suggested that effective prenatal care is significantly related to positive outcomes for the teen mother and her infant. One aspect of prenatal care is the efforts of the pregnant teen to care for herself, often called self-care practices. The purpose of this article is to compare the self-reported self-care activities of pregnant teenagers who sought prenatal care during the first trimester of their pregnancies with those of pregnant teens who delayed prenatal care until the third trimester. The subjects were adolescent girls who were enrolled in prenatal care programs or who had recently delivered in Florida. Interview analysis suggested that both groups had an adequate knowledge level regarding diet, exercise, and other topics related to self-care during pregnancy. Although pregnant teens practice similar self-care behaviors regardless of when they enter prenatal care, there are many problems that may lead to poor pregnancy outcomes and can remain undetected when prenatal care is delayed. PIP: Nurse practitioners interviewed 48 adolescents who were either pregnant or had just delivered to learn how they cared for themselves. The teens were attending or had attended prenatal clinics in Florida. They were divided into 2 groups: 34 teens who began prenatal care in the 1st trimester and 12 teens who did in the 3rd trimester. 73% of teens in the early group considered prenatal care as a self-care activity, while just 1 in the late group did. All but 1 teen practiced self-care throughout the pregnancy, sometimes before formally entering prenatal care. 94.1% in the early group and 83.3% in the late group reported that family members helped with self-care. Some nutrition self-care activities were increased intake of milk and vegetables and a decrease of elimination of fatty foods and caffeine. 97% in the early group and 75% in the late group enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children program. 54% in the early group and 41% in the late group used vitamin and mineral supplements. 67.6% in early group and 75% in late group either continued or began to exercise during pregnancy. 35.2% in the early group and 41.6% in the late group took more time to sleep and rest. Even though some teens abused substances before pregnancy, they all reported no drug or alcohol use during pregnancy. 3 early-group teens and 1 late-group teen still smokes cigarettes, even though they knew it was unhealthy for the baby. Most teens avoided strenuous activities, e.g., team sports. Even though the teens practiced self-care, delay of prenatal care can still lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. An increased need exists for health education or self-care in public schools and during routine preventive health care, mass media campaigns on pregnancy signs and symptoms and early prenatal care, and support from parents and other family members.

Hulshof KF(1), Wedel M, Löwik MR, Kok FJ, Kistemaker C, Hermus RJ, ten Hoor F, Ockhuizen T. Author information: (1)Department of Human Nutrition, TNO Toxicology and Nutrition Institute, Ziest, The Netherlands. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate whether dietary factors cluster in a favourable or unfavourable way and to characterise the groups identified by lifestyle and sociodemographic variables. DESIGN AND SETTING: This cross sectional study was based on data of the 1987-1988 Dutch national food consumption survey (DNFCS), obtained from a panel by a stratified probability sample of the non-institutionalised Dutch population. PARTICIPANTS: 3781 adults (1802 males and 1979 females) of the DNFCS, aged 19 to 85 years, were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: To estimate dietary intake two day food records were used. Lifestyle factors were collected by structured questionnaire and sociodemographic variables were available from panel information. Cluster analysis was used to classify subjects into groups based on similarities in dietary variables. Subsequently, these groups were characterised by sociodemographic and lifestyle factors as well as by the consumption of food groups. Eight clusters were found. In comparison with the guidelines, the dietary quality in four clusters was poor. The cluster with the poorest dietary intake (high intake of fat, cholesterol, and alcohol; low intake of dietary fibre) showed on average a high consumption of animal products (except milk), fats and oils, snacks, and alcoholic beverages, and a low consumption of fruit, potatoes, vegetables, and sugar rich products. Smoking, body mass index, dietary regimen on own initiative, hours of sleep, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and day of the week were found to discriminate among the clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster analysis resulted in substantial differences in mean nutrient intake and seems useful for dietary risk group identification. Undesirable lifestyle habits were interrelated in some clusters, but an exclusive lifestyle for health risk has not been found.
