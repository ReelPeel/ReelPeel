Preprompt STEP2:

You are part of a medical fact-checking pipeline.  
If you propagate a false statement, the app may mislead people.

INPUT TRANSCRIPT
---------------
{transcript}
---------------

TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.  
4. Merge duplicate / near-duplicate claims into one concise statement.

STRICT OUTPUT  
A valid JSON array with 1–3 strings.  
No commentary, no extra keys, no markdown.




Prepromt STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app.  
If the claim is too vague, non‐medical, or otherwise unlikely to be indexed in PubMed, output the single word: NONE

Otherwise, **think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).  
• Uses uppercase AND/OR to combine concepts.  
• Wraps MeSH terms in quotes followed by [MeSH] (e.g., "Smoking"[MeSH]).  
• Marks synonym or free‐text terms with [tiab] (e.g., smoking[tiab]).  
• Groups synonyms with parentheses; groups PICO domains by combining with AND.  
• Does not include field tags other than [MeSH] and [tiab].  
• Does not include quotation marks around free‐text terms (other than MeSH).  
• Begins with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and contains no leading/trailing spaces.  
• Contains no line breaks or extra whitespace.

CLAIM:
{claim}




Preprompt STEP5:

You are summarising evidence for a medical fact-checker.  
Think briefly (silently) about study design and main results, then write the summary.

GUIDELINES  
• ≤ 300 words, plain text.  
• Focus on methods, population, key outcomes, effect sizes, and limitations.  
• Do NOT add interpretation beyond the abstract itself.

TEXT TO SUMMARISE
-----------------
{abstract}
-----------------




Preprompt STEP6:

You are verifying whether the summary actually addresses the claim.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

Hamilton H, Inder M(1). Author information: (1)University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand. INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition where many individuals experience difficulty getting well and staying well with ongoing symptoms and frequent relapses reflecting the limitation of current treatment approaches. Living with bipolar disorder touches every aspect of the individual's life and access to more effective treatments is necessary. The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of receiving a bipolar specific psychological intervention, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy. METHODS: This paper is a first-person narrative that reflects my experience of bipolar disorder including the different treatment approaches and their impact. FINDINGS: This Lived Experience Narrative reflects the significant limitations of medication focused and crisis short-term driven treatment which created an imbalanced approach limiting my ability to achieve significant periods of wellness. Having access to Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy fundamentally changed the approach to managing bipolar disorder. Over time this led to me having an increased sense of control, where bipolar disorder was something to work with rather than an external force controlling life and decisions, resulting in greater periods of wellness and stability. DISCUSSION: This narrative highlights the critical importance of having access to bipolar disorder specific interventions that go beyond medication and acute treatment approaches. Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy provides an understanding and approach that enables the individual with bipolar disorder to implement strategies and tools to more effectively manage their condition and to navigate a meaningful future. © 2025 The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This paper presents a first-person narrative exploring the impact of Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) on managing bipolar disorder. The author, a person living with bipolar disorder, describes their experiences with various treatment approaches, focusing on the limitations of medication-focused and crisis-driven care. The narrative details a shift toward IPSRT, which reportedly fostered a greater sense of control and allowed the author to view bipolar disorder as manageable rather than externally imposed. The reported outcome was an increased period of wellness and stability.

The study’s primary limitation is its design as a single, subjective narrative. Therefore, it cannot provide quantitative data or generalizable findings. It offers a qualitative exploration of one individual’s experience and highlights the potential value of IPSRT, but does not establish causality or effect size.

INTRODUCTION: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common and concerning behavior in adolescents. However, most adolescents cease NSSI as they transition into adulthood. Increased knowledge of the cessation process is needed. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the factors contributing to NSSI cessation in individuals with lived experience of NSSI, providing valuable insights for treatment strategies. METHODS: Twenty-six individuals assigned female sex at birth, between ages 20-22 years, from Sweden were interviewed between 2021 and 2023 in Linköping, Sweden. Of these, 21 individuals perceived themselves as having ceased NSSI and were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis and Hooley and Franklins' Benefits and Barriers Model of NSSI were used to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were generated: "Something inside me changed", "Something in my close relationships changed", and "Something in my life context changed". The cessation of NSSI was associated with several key factors. Improved well-being and envisioning a different future were pivotal in initiating the cessation process. Additionally, interpersonal relationships and support from others were interpreted as powerful motivators for change. Transitioning to a new social context and leaving behind a destructive environment provided opportunities for personal growth and enhanced well-being, interpreted as initiators in the participants' broader life context. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the complexity of the NSSI cessation process and highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors. Access to emotion regulation skills was perceived as a significant barrier to NSSI engagement. Clinical implications and different interventions to support NSSI cessation are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This qualitative study explored factors associated with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) cessation in young adults. Researchers interviewed 26 individuals assigned female sex at birth, aged 20-22 years, in Sweden between 2021 and 2023. The analysis focused on 21 participants who reported having ceased NSSI. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, guided by Hooley and Franklin’s Benefits and Barriers Model. Three overarching themes emerged: personal change ("Something inside me changed"), relationship changes ("Something in my close relationships changed"), and broader life context changes ("Something in my life context changed"). Key factors linked to cessation included improved well-being, envisioning a positive future, supportive relationships, and transitions to new social environments. A lack of emotion regulation skills was identified as a barrier to NSSI engagement. The study's limitations include the focus on a specific population (young women in Sweden), potentially limiting generalizability, and reliance on self-reported experiences.

BACKGROUND: Between 2015 and 2019 the Chronic Headache Education and Self-management Study (CHESS) developed and tested a supportive self-management approach that aimed to improve outcomes for people with chronic migraine or chronic tension type headache with/without episodic migraine. However, a paucity of qualitative research which explored the lived experiences of people with chronic headache was evidenced. In response, we undertook to explore the experiences of living with chronic headaches of people who participated in the CHESS study. METHODS: We adopted qualitative methodologies, inviting participants in the CHESS study to participate in semi-structured interviews. In phase 1 (feasibility study), a thematic analysis was conducted. In phase 2 (main CHESS trial), interviews were informed by topic guides developed from our learning from the phase 1 interviews. Pen portrait methodology and thematic analysis was employed allowing us to explore the data longitudinally. RESULTS: Phase 1, 15 interviews (10 female) age range 29 to 69 years (median 47 years) revealed the complexities of living with chronic headache. Six overarching themes were identified including the emotional impact and the nature of their headaches. Phase 2, included 66 interviews (26 participants; median age group 50s (range 20s-60s); 20 females. 14 were interviewed at three points in time (baseline, 4 and 12 months) Through an iterative process four overlapping categories of headache impact emerged from the data and were agreed: i) 'I will not let headaches rule my life'; ii) 'Headaches rule my life'; iii) 'Headaches out of control-something needs to change'; and iv) 'Headaches controlled-not ruling my life'. One of these categories was assigned to each pen portrait at each timepoint. The remaining 12 participants were interviewed at two time points during a year; pen portraits were again produced. Analysis revealed that the headache impact categories developed above held true in this sample also providing some validation of the categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data give an insight into the complexities of living with chronic headache. Chronic headache is unpredictable, permeating all aspects of an individual's life; even when an individual feels that their headache is controlled and not interfering, this situation can rapidly change. It shows us that more work needs to be done both medically and societally to help people living with this often-hidden condition. © 2024. The Author(s).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This qualitative study explored the lived experiences of individuals with chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache who participated in the Chronic Headache Education and Self-management Study (CHESS). Researchers used semi-structured interviews within a two-phase design. Phase 1 (feasibility) involved 15 interviews (10 female, ages 29-69 years, median 47 years) and identified six overarching themes related to the emotional impact and nature of chronic headache. Phase 2 included 66 interviews (26 participants; median age group 50s, range 20s-60s; 20 female). A subset of 14 participants were interviewed at baseline, 4, and 12 months, and another 12 at two timepoints. Thematic analysis, alongside pen portrait methodology, revealed four overlapping categories of headache impact: 'I will not let headaches rule my life', 'Headaches rule my life', 'Headaches out of control-something needs to change', and 'Headaches controlled-not ruling my life'. The categories demonstrated consistency across participants and timepoints. The study highlights the unpredictable nature of chronic headache and its pervasive impact on individuals’ lives.

Author information: (1)University of Porto Institute of Biomedical Sciences Abel Salazar, Aveiro, Portugal. (2)University of Aveiro, Portugal. (3)University of the Balearic Islands, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain. The process of transitioning involves making changes to align one's life with their authentic gender identity. This study explores the life trajectories of three Portuguese transgender women who transitioned later in life (50+ years old) by identifying key chapters in their life courses. Through inductive thematic analysis, six chapters were identified from the participants' interviews: (1) awareness of "something different in me," (2) locked into suffering, (3) finding comfort in something that is socially recognized, (4) "it is enough": it is time to recognize and embrace the woman I am, (5) living my life as a woman, and (6) building and leaving a legacy. Aging and the process of self-discovery played pivotal roles in participants' process of transitioning. The perception of finitude and the limitations associated with the time of life led them to realize that there was no time to waste and a sense of urgency to live authentically. Publisher: O processo de transição envolve mudanças para alinhar a vida com a identidade de género autêntica. Este estudo explora as trajetórias de vida de três mulheres transgénero portuguesas que fizeram a transição mais tardia (depois dos 50 anos), identificando capítulos-chave nos seus percursos de vida. Através da análise temática indutiva, foram identificados seis capítulos a partir das entrevistas dos participantes: (1) consciência de “algo diferente em mim,” (2) fechada no sofrimento, (3) encontrar conforto em algo que é socialmente reconhecido, (4) “já chega:” é altura de reconhecer a mulher que sou, (5) viver a minha vida como mulher, e (6) construir e deixar um legado. O envelhecimento e o processo de autodescoberta desempenharam papéis fundamentais no processo de transição das participantes. A perceção da finitude e das limitações associadas ao tempo de vida levou-as a perceber que não havia tempo a perder, dando um sentido de urgência para viver de forma autêntica. © The Author(s) 2024.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This qualitative study explored the life trajectories of three Portuguese transgender women who transitioned at age 50 or older. The study used inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews to identify key chapters in the participants’ life courses. The sample consisted of three participants, limiting generalizability. Six chapters emerged from the analysis: (1) awareness of gender incongruence, (2) a period of suffering, (3) finding socially recognized comfort, (4) self-recognition and embracing their gender identity, (5) living as a woman, and (6) legacy building. Participants reported that aging and self-discovery were central to their transition process, and the perception of limited time fostered a sense of urgency to live authentically. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This short opinion piece, published in The Health Services Journal, does not present original research findings but discusses the suitability of children and young people to participate in governance roles within healthcare organizations. It examines the increasing trend of involving children and young people in decision-making processes, referencing examples of youth advisory groups and involvement in service planning.

The article does not detail a specific study population or methodology. It broadly considers the potential benefits of youth involvement, such as increased accountability and improved services designed with children's needs in mind. It also explores potential challenges, including ensuring meaningful participation, addressing power imbalances, and managing expectations. 

The author does not report quantitative effect sizes or statistical significance. The discussion focuses on qualitative observations and anecdotal evidence of youth engagement.

A key limitation is the absence of empirical data or a systematic review.  The piece is primarily a commentary on a growing trend rather than a rigorous evaluation of its impact.  The author acknowledges the need for further research to determine best practices and evaluate the effectiveness of youth involvement in healthcare governance.

Author information: (1)University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: AI is changing healthcare and potentially even how humans interpret and express empathy. Patients and healthcare professionals are consulting AI for medical concerns, so it is critical to identify when AI expressions of empathy are helpful versus harmful. Whether or not AI is considered genuinely empathetic, the common goal is to improve AI outputs as well as healthcare outcomes. The paper explores how generative AI can impact care in a digital future. METHODS: We develop a tool for evaluating empathy called the Chatbot Compassion Quotient, or CCQ. We created a set of nine prompts, assessing compassion in various capacities, including delivering difficult news and alleviating frustration, based on the psychology literature. We compare ChatGPT and Claude-generated responses with responses from healthcare professionals. Participants also guessed which of the responses was AI-generated versus human-generated. In this corollary to the Turing test, the central question "can machines think?" became "can machines demonstrate compassion?" Thirty participants rated 3 responses to 9 scenarios on a 5-point Likert scale of 1 (not at all compassionate) to 5 (very compassionate). Responses corresponded to either ChatGPT, human, or Claude-generated results and were labeled A, B, and C in random order. After rating on the compassion scale, participants were asked to identify which, between two options, was AI-generated. RESULTS: Results indicated that participants considered responses from ChatGPT (aggregate score: 4.1 out of 5) and Claude (aggregate score: 4.1 out of 5) more empathetic than human (aggregate score: 2.6 out of 5) responses, with length being a potential factor impacting evaluations. Longer responses were typically rated as more compassionate. The scores for ChatGPT and Claude were comparable. Responses that appeared most obviously AI-generated performed well compared to human responses. High-scoring responses were action-oriented with multiple forms of social support. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the promise of human-machine synergy in healthcare. AI may alleviate fatigue and burnout in the medical field, contributing thorough responses that offer insight into patient-centered care. Further research can build on these preliminary findings to evaluate and improve expressions of empathy in AI. Copyright © 2025 Muthukumar.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated perceptions of empathy in AI-generated healthcare responses compared to those from human healthcare professionals. The authors developed a "Chatbot Compassion Quotient" (CCQ) tool using nine prompts designed to assess compassion in various healthcare scenarios. Responses from ChatGPT, Claude, and human professionals were evaluated by 30 participants who rated them on a 5-point Likert scale (1-5) regarding compassion. Participants also attempted to identify AI-generated responses. 

Results showed that both ChatGPT (mean score 4.1/5) and Claude (mean score 4.1/5) were rated as more compassionate than human responses (mean score 2.6/5). Response length appeared to influence ratings, with longer responses generally perceived as more compassionate. The performance of AI-generated responses that were clearly identifiable as such was comparable to human responses. 

A limitation of the study is that it was conducted by a single author and relies on subjective participant ratings. Further research is suggested to refine and validate the CCQ and explore the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare.

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a deep learning task aims at tracing students' knowledge states and predicting their future performance. However, existing methods overlook the impact of dynamically changing comprehensive difficulty on students' knowledge states, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, students' correct responses may sometimes result from lucky guesses, making it difficult for models to accurately update comprehensive difficulty and effectively trace students' knowledge states. To address these challenges, we propose DDKC, the novel Dynamic comprehensive Difficulty Knowledge Cells, which incorporates two key components: (1) the dynamic comprehensive difficulty knowledge cells incorporating KAN network, to dynamically update the comprehensive difficulty according to students' evolving knowledge mastery level; (2) a novel training strategy based on Stable Learning, to mitigate spurious correlations caused by students' lucky guesses, and focus more on tracing their real knowledge states. We evaluate DDKC on several public educational datasets, demonstrating that it surpasses current state-of-the-art models, and exhibits excellent interpretability in capturing dynamic changes in comprehensive difficulty and eliminating spurious correlations.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study introduces DDKC, a novel approach to Knowledge Tracing (KT), a deep learning task focused on predicting student performance. The authors address limitations of existing KT models by incorporating dynamic adjustments for comprehensive difficulty and a stable learning training strategy. The method utilizes Dynamic comprehensive Difficulty Knowledge Cells incorporating a KAN network to update difficulty based on student knowledge mastery. Stable Learning is implemented to reduce the impact of lucky guesses on model training.

The study evaluated DDKC on several publicly available educational datasets. Results demonstrated that DDKC outperformed current state-of-the-art KT models. The authors also claim the model provides improved interpretability in tracking changes in difficulty and mitigating spurious correlations.

A limitation is the lack of detail regarding the specific datasets used, the size of the student populations assessed, and the magnitude of the performance improvements achieved. The study focuses on methodological development and validation rather than a comprehensive analysis of the impact of DDKC on student learning outcomes.

Predicting Ultra-High Risk Outcomes Using Linguistic and Acoustic Measures From High-Risk Social Challenge Recordings: mHealth Longitudinal Cohort Exploratory Study.

(4)WKW School of Communications, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore. BACKGROUND: Early detection of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis is critical for timely intervention and improving clinical outcomes. However, current UHR assessments, which rely heavily on psychometric tools, often suffer from low specificity. Speech-based machine learning prediction models can potentially be used to improve prognostic accuracy. However, existing studies often used long, open-ended speech tasks, which limit scalability. The High-Risk Social Challenge (HiSoC) is a short 45-second speech task designed to measure social functioning in individuals with UHR. If the HiSoC task is able to capture predictive signals, it may serve as an effective and scalable speech task for future prediction models. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to explore whether linguistic and acoustic features extracted from the HiSoC task are associated with UHR outcomes and if they are predictive of different UHR outcomes. METHODS: Audio recordings of HiSoC task responses were collected from 41 participants with UHR enrolled in the Longitudinal Youth at Risk Study. A total of 12 individuals converted to psychosis, 15 remitted from UHR status, and 14 maintained UHR status. The responses from the converted group were obtained within 12 months of psychosis onset, while the responses from the remitted and maintained groups were collected at baseline. Linguistic features analyzed included words per minute, articulation rate, dysfluency, and sequential coherence. Acoustic features comprised the mean and SD of fundamental frequency, the mean and SD of intensity, and HF500. Feature differential analysis was conducted via multivariate linear regression. Linear support vector machines were trained as outcome prediction models. Nested cross-validation was used to estimate the generalizability error. The models were principally evaluated on balanced accuracy (BA). RESULTS: The converted group exhibited lower words per minute (adjusted P=.02) and higher dysfluency (adjusted P=.004) compared to the remitted group. No significant differences were found in articulation rate, sequential coherence, or acoustic measures across the outcome groups. Two models outperformed random guess, namely the models using linguistic variables (BA 0.741, 95% CI 0.521-0.882) and linguistic and acoustic variables (BA 0.851, 95% CI 0.508-0.944). CONCLUSIONS: Linguistic features extracted from a short speech task exhibit a measurable difference between the outcome groups. Our findings support the feasibility of using signals extracted from the HiSoC task recordings to predict remission in participants with UHR. © Samuel Ming Xuan Tan, May Yen Lieu, Jun Kai, Zixu Yang, Luke KK, May O Lwin, Jimmy Lee, Wilson Wen Bin Goh.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This exploratory study investigated the potential of linguistic and acoustic features extracted from the High-Risk Social Challenge (HiSoC) task to predict outcomes in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Researchers analyzed audio recordings from 41 participants enrolled in the Longitudinal Youth at Risk Study, categorized into three groups: those who converted to psychosis (n=12), those who remitted from UHR (n=15), and those who maintained UHR status (n=14). Linguistic features analyzed included words per minute, articulation rate, dysfluency, and sequential coherence; acoustic features included fundamental frequency and intensity measures, and HF500. Multivariate linear regression was used for feature differential analysis, and linear support vector machines were trained to predict outcomes, with nested cross-validation used to estimate generalizability. The group that converted to psychosis demonstrated significantly lower words per minute (adjusted P=.02) and higher dysfluency (adjusted P=.004) compared to the remitted group. Models incorporating linguistic variables (BA 0.741, 95% CI 0.521-0.882) and both linguistic and acoustic variables (BA 0.851, 95% CI 0.508-0.944) outperformed chance. The study's limitations include the relatively small sample size and the exploratory nature of the analysis.

Güner Gültekin D(1), Akıncı FN(2). Author information: (1)School of Business and Management Sciences, İstanbul Medipol University, Istanbul 34815, Türkiye. (2)Faculty of Education, Yıldız Technical University, Istanbul 34165, Türkiye. Cognitive biases have been proved to have a systematic influence on decision-making at both individual and social levels. This study investigated two forms of overconfidence-specifically, overestimation and overplacement-among young individuals participating in a social prediction task using an experimental design. The experimental study was conducted with 414 undergraduate students during an in-class written exam. Participants were drawn from different courses taught by the same instructor and varied in terms of their level of prior interaction with the instructor (having attended one, two, or three semesters). Participants predicted the instructor's favourite songs and subsequently evaluated the accuracy of their own predictions and those of their classmates. This experimental design allowed the researchers to look at both how accurately participants judged themselves and how they compared themselves to their peers. The analysis primarily focused on discrepancies between self-evaluated and actual performance. Results revealed a consistent pattern of overestimation and overplacement. Participants rated themselves as more successful than they actually were and positioned themselves above the average of their peer group. Moreover, the lack of direct feedback and limited contextual cues in the guessing task created a psychological ambiguity, which may have contributed to an unjustified sense of certainty among the participants. These findings offer empirical insight into the functioning of cognitive biases and contribute to a nuanced understanding of overconfidence in young decision-makers.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This experimental study investigated overconfidence biases (overestimation and overplacement) in young adults. Researchers recruited 414 undergraduate students from various courses taught by the same instructor, varying their prior interaction with the instructor (1-3 semesters). Participants engaged in a social prediction task – predicting the instructor’s favorite songs – and subsequently rated their own and their peers’ accuracy. The study design allowed for comparison of self-reported accuracy against actual performance and relative ranking among peers. Results indicated that participants consistently overestimated their own performance accuracy and ranked themselves above the average performance of their classmates. The authors suggest that limited feedback and contextual cues during the task may have contributed to this unjustified sense of certainty. The study’s limitation is the specific population studied (undergraduate students) and the artificial nature of the prediction task.

"Listening with Your Heart": Autism Support Program Faculty Experiences in Teaching Autistic College Students. Nachman BR(1). Author information: (1)University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. BACKGROUND: As more autistic college students enroll in higher education, the need for capable faculty to support their learning experiences rises. Although well intentioned, many educators are not always the most adept in supporting their autistic learners. This descriptive phenomenological reflective lifeworld research seeks to understand the essence of autism-specific college support program faculty experiences in teaching autistic college students. METHODS: This study entailed conducting interviews with four full-time faculty, two staff who teach part-time, and eight other administrators or staff at a community college boasting an autism-specific college support program. Additionally, the author drew on observing a classroom session, program information session, and the campus via a tour, as well as course syllabi, to provide a fuller picture. Dahlberg and colleagues' data analysis methods provided a mechanism for interpreting the information. RESULTS: Four themes helped describe the essence of faculty experiences in teaching their autistic learners: unfamiliarity, flexibility, disruption, and optimism. Whereas faculty may, at first, lack familiarity with autism, they draw on that desire for further knowledge to directly learn from their students, creating opportunities for trust building. They also welcome feedback from students and fellow staff alike to engage in flexible teaching techniques. Adaptability and willingness to learn help them navigate difficult course experiences. These experiences ultimately enhance faculty members' confidence to teach autistic learners and translate inclusive teaching measures to their courses writ large. CONCLUSION: This study unveils the many aspects of faculty members' experiences in interacting with autistic students, particularly within the unique landscape of a college with an autism-specific college support program that highlights neurodiversity. Importantly, this study contributes new knowledge about how faculty draw on their resources, knowledge, and past teaching experiences to shape their iterative approaches to working with autistic students. COMMUNITY BRIEF: Why is this an important issue?: Autistic college students are increasingly enrolling in higher education institutions, yet many of the faculty and staff who work with them are unaware of, and unprepared to, support their classroom experiences. This issue contributes to faculty sometimes misunderstanding autistic students and missing opportunities to build more inclusive classrooms.What was the purpose of the study?: My aim was to find out what faculty experience in working with autistic learners, and how they adapt their teaching approaches.What did the researcher do?: This study was set in a community college, with an autism-specific college support program that works toward college and career skills for its neurodivergent learners. I conducted interviews with four full-time faculty teaching in this program, two additional part-time faculty who are college staff, and two additional staff members. I also observed a class session and program information session, toured the campus, and reviewed all current course syllabi to understand faculty members' evolving experiences in supporting autistic learners.What were the results of the study?: I found that faculty felt a mix of emotions and adopted various teaching approaches, when working with autistic college students. For instance, faculty often entered from a place of unfamiliarity, though they sought knowledge from colleagues and additional resources to enhance their understanding of, and comfort to teach, autistic learners. This context helped them in navigating moments when students acted in a disruptive manner. Many faculty relied on past course experiences, and interactions with autistic learners, to inform their feelings of optimism in teaching future students.What do these findings add to what was already known?: To date, while there have been a handful of studies focused on faculty members' engagement with autistic learners, few have concentrated on settings within an autism-specific college support program. Study findings show how faculty working in these environments committed to neurodiversity, incorporated inclusive and transferable teaching techniques, while also growing in their comfort and confidence to work with autistic learners.What are the potential weaknesses of the study?: As I engaged only with faculty members teaching in, and staff familiar with, the autism-specific college support program, I did not necessarily gather perspective from individuals with less context on neurodiversity. In the end, the campus and participants selected for this study may not be representative of most college campuses without such autism acceptance.How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?: Study findings will give perspective into how faculty members can more inclusively serve autistic learners, ultimately benefitting the academic experiences of future generations of autistic students entering college.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This descriptive phenomenological study explored the experiences of faculty teaching autistic college students within a community college’s autism-specific support program. The study aimed to understand the essence of these experiences and how faculty adapt their teaching approaches. Data were collected through interviews with four full-time faculty, two part-time staff instructors, and eight administrators/staff members. Observations of a classroom session, program information session, campus tour, and review of course syllabi supplemented the interview data. Thematic analysis, guided by Dahlberg et al.’s methods, identified four key themes: unfamiliarity, flexibility, disruption, and optimism. Faculty initially lacked familiarity with autism but actively sought knowledge from students and colleagues, adopting flexible teaching techniques and navigating disruptive moments. These experiences ultimately fostered confidence and encouraged the incorporation of inclusive teaching practices. A limitation of the study is that it focused exclusively on faculty and staff familiar with the autism-specific program, potentially limiting generalizability to broader college settings. The study contributes a nuanced understanding of faculty experiences within a neurodiversity-supportive environment and suggests strategies for inclusive teaching practices benefiting autistic students.

INTRODUCTION: Gender equity for anaesthetists remains elusive, despite patient and clinician benefits. Many strategies have been proposed to promote gender equity, yet women remain under-represented in anaesthesia leadership compared with men. This review identifies contemporary implemented strategies to improve gender equity in anaesthesia leadership. METHODS: We searched databases for studies published from January 2019 to March 2024, including reports of implementation. We employed state-of-the-art review methodology to provide a current understanding of this complex sociocultural problem, using Cook's and Stufflebeam frameworks for categorisation and deductive data extraction and analysis based on context, inputs, processes and outcomes. RESULTS: We screened 257 abstracts and identified 18 studies for analysis; 14 were conducted in the USA. The most prominent individual interventions were mentorship and sponsorship. These were supported by organisational interventions including professional development curricula; policies; and leadership roles supporting diversity. Two studies reported how programmes were iteratively developed. Reported success metrics included quantitative (increased diversity in leadership, achieving promotion) and qualitative outcomes (networks and wellbeing). DISCUSSION: Evidence for best practices to address gender equity in anaesthesia leadership is emerging. Prospective determination of key outcomes enables monitoring of success, including representation and wellbeing. Organisational support, in the form of policies and leadership roles linked to diversity outcomes, amplifies the benefits of mentorship and sponsorship. Future interventions should report the context in which the interventions were mobilised, associated costs and details of the iterative programme delivery and development process. Plain Language Summary: WHAT WE DID?: We looked at many recent studies to find out what people are doing right now to help make leadership in anaesthesia more fair for women. We searched for studies from 2019 to 2024 and chose 18 that explained real actions taken to improve gender fairness. WHY DID WE DO IT?: Women are still not employed as often as men in top anaesthesia jobs, even though fairness helps both patients and doctors. Many ideas have been suggested, but we wanted to know which ones are actually being tried and whether they seem to work. WHAT WE FOUND?: The most common helpful actions were mentorship (helping someone learn and grow) and sponsorship (supporting someone so they can get new opportunities). Hospitals and organisations also used policies, training programmes and leadership roles that focused on fairness and diversity. Some programmes showed success by increasing the number of women in leadership and helping people feel more supported and connected. The best results happened when organisations backed these efforts with clear plans and leaders responsible for making fairness a priority. Overall, the research shows that solutions that address the problem at different levels improve fairness, but there is still more work to do. © 2025 Association of Anaesthetists.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This review summarises contemporary strategies to improve gender equity in anaesthesia leadership. Researchers used a state-of-the-art review methodology, employing Cook’s and Stufflebeam frameworks for data extraction and analysis, to evaluate interventions implemented between January 2019 and March 2024. A search of databases yielded 18 studies for analysis, with the majority (14) conducted in the USA. Key interventions included mentorship and sponsorship, often supported by organisational initiatives such as professional development curricula, diversity-focused policies, and leadership roles. Two studies described iterative programme development processes. Reported outcomes were both quantitative (e.g., increased representation in leadership, promotion rates) and qualitative (e.g., improved networks and wellbeing). The review suggests that organisational support, including policies and leadership roles linked to diversity, enhances the effectiveness of mentorship and sponsorship. A limitation is the potential for bias introduced by the focused search and the geographic concentration of included studies (primarily USA). Future research should detail contextual factors, costs, and iterative development processes associated with interventions.

Funders increasingly emphasise patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) as an integral component of health and biomedical research. This shift reflects broader commitments to inclusivity, transparency and accountability, recognising that lived experiences enhance the relevance, feasibility and impact of research. PPIE can improve study design, recruitment and dissemination, supporting a transition from expert-led to co-created knowledge generation. However, funders sometimes provide little or no feedback on unsuccessful grant applications, typically citing capacity constraints. While some organisations offer constructive critique, others-especially smaller funders-do not, undermining the very participatory principles they aim to promote. Lack of feedback hampers researchers' professional development and disproportionately affects early-career academics, underrepresented groups and those without strong institutional support. It also risks discouraging public contributors who invest time and emotional effort in co-developing proposals, eroding trust and diminishing willingness to engage in the future. This disconnect between expectation and communication reinforces systemic inequities and risks reducing PPIE to a symbolic gesture. Strengthening response mechanisms is both a practical necessity and a moral and ethical obligation. Constructive critique is central to scientific progress; without it, the promise of PPIE to foster a reciprocal and transformative partnership risks being undermined, at a time when public trust in science is already fragile. We believe that current funding systems need to acknowledge their responsibility to deliver meaningful feedback, even within the realities of constrained resources. Plain Language Summary: Scientists are now expected to work closely with patients and the public when planning and carrying out studies. This is especially the case in health research. Involving people with lived experience helps make research more relevant and useful. It can also improve research questions, study design and how results are shared. However, when funding applications are rejected, some funders give little or no feedback. This makes it hard for researchers—especially those at the start of their careers or working in underrepresented areas—to learn and improve. It can also discourage members of the public who gave their time to help shape a proposal but never hear why it failed. Without proper feedback, trust in the funding process and in research itself can suffer. It risks making public involvement feel like a box-ticking exercise instead of genuine partnership. We believe that funders could help by providing even brief, clear feedback. © 2025. The Author(s). DOI: 10.1186/s40900-025-00813-0 Conflict of interest statement: Declarations.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This paper addresses the lack of feedback provided by research funders on unsuccessful grant applications that include patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE). The authors, including public contributors, highlight that while funders increasingly emphasize PPIE as crucial for research relevance and impact, the absence of feedback on rejected proposals hinders researcher development and discourages public involvement. The study does not report quantitative data or a formal study design; it is presented as a call for action based on the authors' experiences and observations within the research funding landscape. The key outcome of concern is the negative impact on researchers, particularly early-career academics and those from underrepresented groups, and on the willingness of public contributors to engage in future proposals. A limitation is the absence of empirical data quantifying the extent of the problem or the precise impact of feedback (or lack thereof). The authors acknowledge resource constraints faced by funders but argue that providing feedback, even brief, is a moral and ethical obligation essential for maintaining trust and fostering genuine partnership between researchers and the public.

"I've Absolutely Reached Rock Bottom and Have No Energy": The Lived Experience of Unemployed and Underemployed Autistic Adults. Smethurst LJ(1), Thompson AR(2), Freeth M(1). Author information: (1)Sheffield Autism Research Lab, Psychology Department, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK. (2)South Wales Clinical Psychology Training, Cardiff & the Vale University Health Board/Cardiff University, Cardiff, New York, USA. BACKGROUND: Autistic adults are underrepresented in the employment market, and those in work are commonly underemployed. Our study aimed to gain an understanding of autistic adults' experiences of unemployment and underemployment. METHODS: Eight autistic adults who self-identified as currently unemployed or underemployed who were actively seeking to change their employment status participated in semi-structured interviews, analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Four group experiential themes were identified: feeling paralyzed (the past weighs heavy; fragile self-confidence); powerlessness (lack of agency; systemic support failures); negative perceptions (feeling misunderstood; fear of judgment; pressure to meet societal expectations); and recognizing our needs (managing mental health difficulties; importance of self-understanding). Participants felt paralyzed by employment experiences, which impacted their confidence to progress with their career aspirations. Autistic people felt misunderstood, judged, and powerless within support systems, which had implications for their mental health. Participants recognized the importance of managing their mental health needs during times of unemployment and underemployment via self-care and seeking psychological support. CONCLUSION: Putting resource into understanding, acknowledging, and addressing processes within and around employment should be priorities for policy makers if they are serious about improving support to help autistic people find and stay in work. COMMUNITY BRIEF: Why is this an important issue?: Autistic people are less likely to have a job than non-autistic people. Autistic people who do have a job are likely to work fewer hours than they want, be in a job that that doesn't fully use their skills or education, or not get paid enough to meet their basic needs.What was the purpose of this study?: To communicate autistic adults' experiences of unemployment and underemployment to improve understanding of what this is like and what may help.What did the researchers do?: We developed interview questions in collaboration with two autistic adults. We interviewed eight autistic adults who identified as being unemployed or underemployed who were actively seeking to change their employment status. We asked them about the impact their experiences had on their day-to-day lives. We identified themes from what the interviewees said using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA).What were the results?: Interviewees described feeling paralyzed and stuck at their current employment status because of previous traumatic experiences both within the workplace and around employment processes. They felt misunderstood, judged, and powerless within systems surrounding employment. This impacted their mental health and ability to return to work or progress within their career. Most participants were discovered autistic in adulthood, which increased self-understanding, awareness of employment needs, and the importance of managing their well-being.What do these findings add to what was already known?: The findings demonstrate that prior negative experiences around employment can have profound, enduring effects on autistic adults. This study highlights the challenges faced by autistic adults throughout the employment process and the impact these experiences have on their well-being and ability to progress back into work or within work. Autistic adults experienced a lack of understanding of both autism in general and a lack of empathy toward them as individuals on the part of the employer and colleagues. Further, there was no evidence of responsibility being taken by the employer to mitigate their gaps in knowledge. There is a clear need to work toward practical solutions as highlighted within this study. As such, there is a need for investing resource into understanding, acknowledging, and addressing insufficient and inadequate employment processes, both pre- and post-recruitment.What are potential weaknesses in the study?: Our findings reflect the experiences of a small group of people, so their experiences will not apply to everyone. The majority of the interviewees were discovered autistic in adulthood, and there is a lack of diversity, in that the interviewees were well educated, mostly over the age of 45 years, and mostly White British.How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?: This study helps us better understand the experiences of unemployed and underemployed autistic adults and the barriers they face. Our findings highlight the importance of putting resource into understanding, acknowledging, and addressing these issues around employment for autistic people. This will be imperative for organizations and policy makers if they are serious about improving the employment rates and addressing needs of autistic people.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study explored the lived experiences of unemployed and underemployed autistic adults. Researchers used interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to analyze semi-structured interviews with eight autistic adults who were actively seeking to improve their employment status. Participants were mostly White British, well-educated, over 45 years old, and had received an autism diagnosis in adulthood.

Key themes identified included feeling "paralyzed" by past negative experiences, feeling "powerless" due to systemic support failures and negative perceptions from others, and recognizing the importance of self-understanding and mental health management. Participants reported feeling misunderstood and judged, which negatively impacted their mental health and ability to progress in their careers. They often experienced a lack of employer understanding of autism.

The study’s findings highlight the profound and lasting impact of negative employment experiences on autistic adults. A limitation is the small sample size and lack of diversity within the participant group, meaning the findings may not be generalizable to all autistic adults. The study suggests a need for resources to address inadequate employment processes and improve support for autistic individuals.

(#)Contributed equally Bacteria have developed a variety of immune systems to combat phage infections. The Lamassu system is a prokaryotic immune system with a core conserved structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) superfamily protein LmuB and diverse effectors named LmuA, whose mechanism remains unclear. Here we present a series of cryo-electron microscopy structures of the type-I Lamassu complex from Bacillus cellulasensis and the type-II Lamassu complex from Vibrio cholerae, both in apo and dsDNA-bound states, revealing an unexpected stoichiometry and topological architecture distinct from canonical SMC complexes. Combined structural and biochemical analyses show how the nuclease effector LmuA is sequestered in an inactive monomeric form within the Lamassu complex and, upon sensing foreign DNA ends, dissociates and assembles into an active tetramer capable of DNA cleavage. Our findings elucidate the mechanism by which Lamassu systems detect viral replication and implement antiphage defense, highlighting the roles of SMC proteins in prokaryotic immunity. © 2026.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigates the mechanism of the Lamassu antiphage system, a prokaryotic immune system, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The researchers examined both type-I Lamassu complexes from *Bacillus cellulasensis* and type-II Lamassu complexes from *Vibrio cholerae*, obtaining structures in both unbound (apo) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-bound states. The study population consisted of these two bacterial species. Key findings reveal an atypical stoichiometry and architecture of the Lamassu complex, distinct from typical SMC superfamily protein complexes. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that the nuclease effector, LmuA, is normally inactive as a monomer within the complex. Upon encountering foreign DNA ends, LmuA dissociates and forms an active tetramer capable of DNA cleavage. The study elucidates the mechanism of Lamassu-mediated antiviral defense and the role of SMC proteins in prokaryotic immunity. A limitation is the focus on structural determination and biochemical analysis, without in vivo validation of the proposed mechanism.

(#)Contributed equally Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in the bone marrow in a quiescent state, but can be mobilized into the blood in response to inflammation, cytokine stimulation, nervous activity or hypoxia. Chronic inflammation, a hallmark of aging, accelerates HSC aging by promoting myeloid-biased differentiation and reducing self-renewal capacity, yet the role of mechanical stimulation in regulating these processes remains poorly understood. Here, we found that PIEZO1 senses shear stress in blood flow to induce HSC proliferation and myelopoiesis. We show that shear stress induces PIEZO1-mediated ion currents and Ca2+ influx in both mouse and human HSCs, with downstream effects on proliferation and myeloid differentiation mediated via JAM3 and CAPN2 pathways. GsMTx4, a PIEZO1 antagonist, attenuated inflammation-induced aging in mice by inhibiting HSC activation. These findings link the mechanical sensor PIEZO1 to HSC proliferation and myeloid differentiation via multi-tiered signaling, highlighting its role in accelerating inflammation-induced aging. © 2026.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the role of shear stress and the PIEZO1 mechanosensor in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging. Researchers used a combination of in vivo (mouse models) and in vitro (mouse and human HSCs) experiments. They observed that shear stress, sensed by PIEZO1, induced ion currents and calcium influx in HSCs, leading to increased proliferation and myeloid differentiation via the JAM3 and CAPN2 pathways. Treatment with GsMTx4, a PIEZO1 antagonist, mitigated inflammation-induced aging in mice by inhibiting HSC activation. The study population included both mouse models and human HSCs. The key outcome measured was the impact of shear stress and PIEZO1 on HSC proliferation, myeloid differentiation, and overall aging. A limitation of the study is the reliance on mouse models, which may not fully recapitulate human aging processes; further validation in human studies would be beneficial.

Understanding the nonequilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems is a central goal of modern physics. Measuring genuine many-body correlations in quantum systems is central to this aim, while it remains a fundamental challenge for systems lacking individual addressability. We introduce a multidimensional correlation imprinting technique that encodes the structure of a many-body state into the temporal fluctuation spectrum of a local quantum probe. This allows direct measurement of arbitrary-order correlations in nonequilibrium quantum states. Using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond coupled to a ^{13}C nuclear spin bath, we experimentally reconstruct many-body correlation landscape to third order. Furthermore, by analyzing the spectral structure of correlation cumulants, we directly visualize the dynamics of quantum entanglement. Our Letter establishes a general approach to probing complex nonequilibrium phenomena and entanglement in quantum many-body systems at the nanoscale. DOI: 10.1103/zfk1-7t4d

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study, published in Physical Review Letters, presents a new technique called multidimensional correlation imprinting for measuring many-body correlations in quantum systems. The researchers aimed to directly measure arbitrary-order correlations in nonequilibrium quantum states, a challenging task due to the lack of individual addressability in many systems.

The experimental setup involved a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond coupled to a ^{13}C nuclear spin bath. This system served as a model quantum many-body system. The technique encodes the structure of the many-body state into the temporal fluctuation spectrum of the NV center, allowing for the reconstruction of the many-body correlation landscape to third order. Analysis of spectral structures of correlation cumulants was used to visualize quantum entanglement dynamics.

The study's key outcome is the demonstration of a method for directly measuring many-body correlations and visualizing entanglement in a nanoscale system. The authors report the ability to reconstruct correlations to the third order. A limitation is that the findings are demonstrated in a specific model system (NV center in diamond) and the general applicability to other quantum systems requires further investigation.

While past experiments focused on normal-state conductors, incorporating superconductors holds promise for exploiting the electron-hole degree of freedom in quantum sensing applications and quantum information processing. Here, we propose and analyze an on-demand and tunable mechanism for converting single-electron pulses into holes through Andreev processes on a superconductor. We develop a Floquet-Nambu scattering formalism to demonstrate the dynamic conversion of charge pulses and the controllable generation of coherent electron-hole superpositions through interferometric magnetic flux control based on the chiral edge states of a quantum Hall sample.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study, published in *Physical Review Letters*, proposes and analyzes a mechanism for converting single-electron charge pulses into holes using Andreev processes within a superconducting circuit. The authors developed a Floquet-Nambu scattering formalism to model the dynamic conversion of charge pulses and the generation of coherent electron-hole superpositions. The theoretical framework is based on controlling chiral edge states within a quantum Hall sample via interferometric magnetic flux.

Optimal conditions for the proposed conversion are discussed within the context of currently available technology to assess feasibility. The authors do not report any effect sizes or statistical analyses, as this is a theoretical work. A limitation is that the study is a theoretical proposal and does not present experimental validation of the described mechanism.

In this study, 1-(arylacetyl)-2-phenyl-pyrrolidine derivative VS-13 was identified as a POLθ-pol inhibitor hit with an IC50 value of 1.47 μM through virtual screening. The followed similarity research obtained a more potent analogue SS-5, which was hybridized with RP-6685 to get 1-(phenylacetyl)-2-phenyl-pyrrolidine derivative F-1. It showed potent POLθ inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 170 nM, and good anti-proliferative activity against BRCA2-deficient DLD1 and HCT116 cell lines, with IC50 values of 4.39 μM and 4.79 μM, respectively.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study reports the identification of a novel POLθ inhibitor, F-1, through structure-based virtual screening and fragment fusion techniques. Researchers screened for inhibitors of DNA polymerase theta (POLθ), a target for BRCA-deficient tumors. Initially, compound VS-13 was identified with an IC50 of 1.47 μM. Subsequent similarity research led to the development of analogue SS-5, which was then combined with RP-6685 to create F-1. 

F-1 demonstrated potent POLθ inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 170 nM. It also exhibited anti-proliferative activity against BRCA2-deficient DLD1 and HCT116 cell lines, with IC50 values of 4.39 μM and 4.79 μM, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations and interaction analysis were used to investigate the binding mode of F-1 with POLθ. The study was conducted by researchers in China and involved in silico methods and cell-based assays. A limitation is the lack of in vivo data.

Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly valuable for cardiovascular prediction and simulation, offering critical support for medical decision-making. These models are particularly useful for predicting disease progression and evaluating potential treatments. A major challenge in these models is to preserve the geometric fidelity of meshes while optimizing parameter efficiency to reduce memory usage, computational resources and execution time. In this paper, we present innovative approaches to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) mesh compression, utilizing both statistical and deep learning models, with a focus on unsupervised learning techniques. We explore principal component analysis (PCA) as a statistical method and compare it with several deep learning models, including a simple autoencoder, an enhanced autoencoder based on PCA, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a graph neural network (GNN). Human aortas are compressed using different statistical and deep learning methods to get the most relevant features. The mesh is reconstructed using the computed features and the error of the reconstructed meshes is compared. Our results indicate that PCA, using 64 principal components, outperforms deep learning models with a comparable latent space of 64, achieving the best overall performance. Among the deep learning approaches, the PCA-based autoencoder demonstrates the highest effectiveness. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/cnm.70124 PMID: 41360499 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The study utilized human aorta meshes, compressing them using each method and then reconstructing them. Performance was assessed by comparing the error between the original and reconstructed meshes. Results indicated that PCA, using 64 principal components, achieved the best overall performance compared to deep learning models with a similar latent space (64 dimensions).

Author information: (1)Independent psychologist, Calvos, Portugal / Rillaar, Belgium. Farina and Schimmenti detail and define the potential consequences for their health when children meet and cannot escape from primary caretakers who neglect, maltreat, and abuse them. They define attachment trauma in this frame and thereby overcome some of the limitations of previous formulations. Inspired by their important work, I try to make a few points. Being ecosystems, we must long and strive to get the useful, to avoid and get rid of the harmful, and to leave alone what is useless. Part of the complexity of our being and becoming is that we include multiple longings and strivings, and that these can be contradictory. Per our very nature, and particularly as children, we long and strive to attach to our primary caretakers, defend against threat, and gain power to act. What to feel, think, and do when caretakers we depend on and must learn from are in fact harmful or useless to us, and the rest of our environment does not care or intervene? What is useful, harmful, and meaningless? Attachment trauma, then, is an ecological injury that evolves when harmful powers of caretakers and others far exceed our own power to act. Being ecosystems, the form the injury takes depends on this reciprocal causing. While it is an injury, it also is a creative effort to live and make sense of a mostd difficult life. © 2025 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This article, "Grasping and Treating Attachment Trauma: A Work in Progress," by Nijenhuis, presents a conceptual definition of attachment trauma and does not report results of empirical study. The author builds upon existing formulations of attachment trauma, defining it as an "ecological injury" arising when children experience neglect, maltreatment, or abuse from primary caretakers and lack external intervention. The theoretical framework posits that attachment trauma results from an imbalance of power where harmful caregiver actions outweigh a child's ability to act and defend. The article suggests that the manifestation of this trauma is dependent on this reciprocal power dynamic. The author proposes that the experience constitutes both an injury and a creative adaptation to a challenging life situation. No specific population is studied, and no quantitative outcomes or effect sizes are reported. The article's limitation is that it offers a theoretical perspective rather than empirical data, and does not include a conflict of interest declaration.

(12)Department of Environment and Geography, University of York, York, England, BACKGROUND: Child and adolescent mental health is a public health priority, and prevention, early intervention, and treatment are identified as national strategic priorities. Children and young people (CYP) in the United Kingdom are experiencing poorer mental health outcomes than ever, and the demand for services is the highest on record. Understanding the effectiveness of school-based interventions for promoting and developing emotional well-being is a core research priority. A school-based intervention that is inclusive and has the potential for widespread delivery is 'Forest School'. Forest schools provide children with immersive experiences in nature that are non-classroom-based and have a core focus on child-led activities and exploration. Despite widespread implementation, evidence about optimal delivery methods for Forest Schools and their impact on mental health and emotional well-being is scarce. This study will generate new knowledge about the feasibility of running a definitive Forest School trial with Key Stage 2 (KS2) children aged between 7-11 inclusive of children with special educational needs and disabilities. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Is Forest School an acceptable and feasible intervention to improve the mental health of KS2 children?Is it feasible to run a cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of Forest School for children in key stage 2 (aged 7-11)? OBJECTIVES: 1. Test feasibility of trial procedures for recruitment, randomisation, and data collection2. Conduct a mixed methods process evaluation to evaluate implementation and fidelity3. Collect feasibility data to support an economic evaluation in a full trial4. Refine the current logic model and optimise the intervention. METHODS: In Work Package (WP) 1, we will conduct a feasibility cluster RCT of a Forest School intervention with 200 children in five schools across Hull, East Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire. We will test the acceptability and feasibility of intervention delivery, assess the feasibility of the trial processes, and establish key parameters for effectiveness. In WP2, we will evaluate the quality and fidelity of intervention delivery through process evaluation, including observations and qualitative interviews. WP3 focused on the preliminary collection of health economic data. WP4 uses focus groups to refine the logic model and optimize the content of the intervention. We seek to produce a manualised toolkit informed by interconnected work packages to inform further research and implementation. The trial was registered in ISRCTN (The United Kingdom's Trial Registry). Clinical Trials Registration Number ISRCTN87263624. PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: This proposal was developed with the active involvement of parents/guardians, children, and schools alongside key stakeholders from the local authority, education, and the community sector. DISSEMINATION: We will develop accessible presentations, online workshops with interactive elements, and newsletters. Producing a set of easily read infographics and creative outputs (video/social media) alongside our children's Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups will be a key output. We anticipate that two publications in open-access peer-reviewed journals will share the quantitative and qualitative findings of the study. Plain Language Summary: More children and young people than ever are experiencing problems with their mental health. It can be hard for them to get the help they need because waiting times for mental health services are often long. Schools are an important place where children can get support for their wellbeing. One approach that may help is spending more time outdoors and connecting with nature, which has been shown to benefit mental health. Forest School is a type of outdoor learning that involves play, exploration, and hands-on activities in nature. These sessions are becoming more common in schools and community settings. Some people believe Forest School can improve children’s mental health, but we don’t yet have strong evidence to show this. WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT? We want to find out if it’s possible to run a larger study in the future to test whether Forest School can help children's mental health. To do this, we’re running a smaller study first, called a “feasibility trial”. This helps us understand what works and what doesn’t before moving on to a bigger project. WHAT WILL WE DO? We will work with primary schools in England that can run Forest School sessions. The schools will be asked to offer similar types of activities.We will include year groups from Key Stage 2. Some children will be randomly chosen to take part in Forest School for 12 weeks. The other children will continue with their usual school activities during that time. After two terms, the second group will also get the chance to take part in Forest School.We will check:If schools can run the programme as planned.If we can collect the right information about children’s mental health and wellbeing.Whether families and school staff are happy with how the study is run.How much it costs to deliver Forest School.We will also interview children, parents, and staff to understand their experiences. INVOLVING CHILDREN PARENTS AND PROFESSIONALS: Our research team includes people with lived experience. One is a parent of children with additional needs, and another is a Forest School teacher who works with children with special educational needs. We’ve also worked closely with young people from a group called Re-Wilding Youth Hull to help design the study in a way that makes sense to them. SHARING WHAT WE FIND: We will create easy-to-understand summaries of our findings and share them with parents, schools, and mental health professionals. We will also publish the results in academic journals and speak about them at health and education conferences.Throughout the study, we’ll use blogs and social media (like Instagram and Twitter) to keep people updated on our progress.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigates the potential for a larger trial of Forest School interventions to improve the mental health of Key Stage 2 (KS2) children (aged 7-11), including those with special educational needs and disabilities. The study aims to assess the feasibility of trial procedures, implementation fidelity, and collect preliminary economic data. 

Five schools in Hull, East Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire will participate, with approximately 200 children randomly assigned to either a 12-week Forest School intervention or usual classroom activities. Following the initial 12 weeks, the control group will also receive the Forest School intervention. Data collection includes observations, qualitative interviews, and assessment of trial processes.  A mixed-methods process evaluation will assess implementation quality and fidelity.  The study also seeks to refine the intervention logic model and optimize content. 

The primary outcomes are feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and data collection, alongside assessment of intervention acceptability and implementation fidelity.  Preliminary economic data will also be gathered. The trial is registered with ISRCTN87263624. Patient and public involvement was integral to the study design, and findings will be disseminated through accessible presentations, workshops, and publications.

Emish M(1), Kelani Z(1), Hassani M(1), Young SD(1)(2). Author information: (1)Department of Informatics, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3100, (2)Department of Emergency Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA The increasing popularity of mHealth presents an opportunity for collecting rich datasets using mobile phone applications (apps). Our health-monitoring mobile application uses motion detection to track an individual's physical activity and location. The data collected are used to improve health outcomes, such as reducing the risk of chronic diseases and promoting healthier lifestyles through analyzing physical activity patterns. Using smartphone motion detection sensors and GPS receivers, we implemented an energy-efficient tracking algorithm that captures user locations whenever they are in motion. To ensure security and efficiency in data collection and storage, encryption algorithms are used with serverless and scalable cloud storage design. The database schema is designed around Mobile Advertising ID (MAID) as a unique identifier for each device, allowing for accurate tracking and high data quality. Our application uses Google's Activity Recognition Application Programming Interface (API) on Android OS or geofencing and motion sensors on iOS to track most smartphones available. In addition, our app leverages blockchain and traditional payments to streamline the compensations and has an intuitive user interface to encourage participation in research. The mobile tracking app was tested for 20 days on an iPhone 14 Pro Max, finding that it accurately captured location during movement and promptly resumed tracking after inactivity periods, while consuming a low percentage of battery life while running in the background.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study describes the development and initial testing of a mobile health application designed to track physical activity and location using smartphone sensors and geolocation. The application utilizes motion detection and GPS receivers, employing Google’s Activity Recognition API on Android and geofencing/motion sensors on iOS. A unique identifier (Mobile Advertising ID) is used for device tracking, and data is stored using encrypted, scalable cloud storage. The application incorporates blockchain and traditional payment systems for participant compensation and features an intuitive user interface.

Initial testing was conducted over 20 days on a single iPhone 14 Pro Max to assess location capture accuracy during movement, resumption of tracking after inactivity, and battery life consumption. Results indicated accurate location tracking during movement and prompt resumption of tracking following inactivity periods with minimal battery drain. The study focuses on application design and technical implementation rather than clinical outcomes. A key limitation is the small sample size and lack of comparator data; further validation across a larger, more diverse population is needed.

Deploying Machine Learning Models Using Progressive Web Applications: Implementation Using a Neural Network Prediction Model for Pneumonia Related Child Mortality in The Gambia. Mohammed NI(1), Jarde A(1), Mackenzie G(1), D'Alessandro U(1), Jeffries D(1). Author information: (1)Medical Research Council Unit, The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Banjul, Gambia. BACKGROUND: Translating research outputs into practical tools for medical practitioners is a neglected area and could have a substantial impact. One of the barriers to implementing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications is their practical deployment in the field. Traditional web-based (i.e., server sided) applications are dependent on reliable internet connections, which may not be readily available in rural areas. Native mobile apps require device specific programming skills as well as contemporary hardware and software, with often rapid and unpredictable platform specific changes. This is a major challenge for using AI/ML tools in resource-limited settings. METHODS: An emerging technology, progressive web applications (PWAs), first introduced by Google in 2015, offers an opportunity to overcome the challenges of deploying bespoke AI/ML systems. The same PWA code can be implemented across all desktop platforms, iOS and Android phones and tablets. In addition to platform independence, a PWA can be designed to be primarily offline. RESULTS: We demonstrate how a neural network-based pneumonia mortality prediction triage tool was migrated from a typical academic framework (paper and web-based prototype) to a tool that can be used offline on any mobile phone-the most convenient deployment vehicle. After an initial online connection to download the software, the application runs entirely offline, reading data from cached memory, and running code via JavaScript. On mobile devices the application is installed as a native app, without the inconvenience of platform specific code through manufacturer code stores. DISCUSSION: We show that an ML application can be deployed as a platform independent offline PWA using a pneumonia-related child mortality prediction tool as an example. The aim of this tool was to assist clinical staff in triaging children for hospital admission, by predicting their risk of death. PWAs function seamlessly when their host devices lose internet connectivity, making them ideal for e-health apps that can help improve health and save lives in resource-limited settings in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 Copyright © 2022 Mohammed, Jarde, Mackenzie, D'Alessandro and Jeffries. DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2021.772620 PMID: 35252109 [Indexed for MEDLINE] Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study describes the implementation of a progressive web application (PWA) to deploy a neural network-based pneumonia mortality prediction tool for triage in The Gambia. The tool was designed to assist clinical staff in predicting a child’s risk of death and guiding hospital admission decisions. The study population is not explicitly defined, but the application is intended for use by clinical staff in a resource-limited setting.

The method involved migrating an existing pneumonia mortality prediction model from a standard web-based prototype to a PWA. PWAs offer platform independence and offline functionality, overcoming limitations of traditional web and native mobile applications. After an initial online download, the application functions offline, utilizing cached memory and JavaScript. It installs as a native app on mobile devices without manufacturer-specific code.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of deploying AI/ML tools as PWAs in settings with unreliable internet connectivity. Specific effect sizes or predictive performance metrics of the pneumonia prediction model itself are not reported in this description of the implementation process. A limitation is the lack of data on the clinical impact or accuracy of the deployed tool in a real-world setting.

Renda L(1), Selçuk ÖT, Eyigör H, Osma Ü, Yılmaz MD. Author information: (1)Department of Ear Nose and Throat, Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Antalya, Turkey. rendalevent@yahoo.com. OBJECTIVE: To determine the hearing levels of participants of a randomized group using a smartphone hearing application and to compare these results with the results from a pure-tone audiogram. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A heterogenous group consisting of both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired participants were included in this study. Pure-tone audiogram thresholds were measured from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz, while smartphone measurements were obtained with a Samsung Galaxy GT-19500 S4 with a bundled headphone running the Hearing Test™ software (e-audiologia.pl), which was downloaded from the Google Play Store as a free application. We compared these results with those obtained from pure-tone audiograms performed by an audiologist as a reference. RESULTS: Validity analysis indicated that the results for each ear and each frequency were excellent (>0.75). We assessed the mean difference between the pure-tone audiogram and the smartphone hearing test results and found the absolute difference to be less than 8.8 dB. CONCLUSION: Smartphone hearing test applications are providing alternative tests that present low-cost solutions. Using the hearing application test may decrease the demand for audiological services in underserved areas. The study suggests that smartphone hearing test results are comparable to pure-tone audiometry results. DOI: 10.5152/iao.2016.1421 PMID: 27340985 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study evaluated the validity of a smartphone hearing test application as a method for determining hearing levels, particularly in underserved areas. Researchers compared results from a smartphone hearing test (Hearing Test™ software on a Samsung Galaxy GT-19500 S4) to pure-tone audiometry performed by an audiologist. The study population was a heterogeneous group of both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired individuals. Smartphone measurements were taken at frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz. Validity analysis showed excellent correlation (>0.75) between the smartphone test and audiometry for each ear and frequency. The mean absolute difference between the two methods was less than 8.8 dB. The authors concluded that smartphone hearing test applications offer a potentially low-cost alternative to traditional audiological services. A limitation of the study is the lack of detail regarding the sample size and demographic characteristics of the participant group.

Author information: (1)University Health Network, Centre for Innovation in Complex Care, Toronto, ON, Canada. Comment in J Med Internet Res. 2014 Jul 17;16(7):e174; discussion e174. doi: 10.2196/jmir.3460. BACKGROUND: Mobile phones with operating systems and capable of running applications (smartphones) are increasingly being used in clinical settings. Medical calculating applications are popular mhealth apps for smartphones. These include, for example, apps that calculate the severity or likelihood of disease-based clinical scoring systems, such as determining the severity of liver disease, the likelihood of having a pulmonary embolism, and risk stratification in acute coronary syndrome. However, the accuracy of these apps has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of smartphone-based medical calculation apps. METHODS: A broad search on Google Play, BlackBerry World, and the iTunes App Store was conducted to find medical calculation apps for smartphones. The list of apps was narrowed down based on inclusion and exclusion criteria focusing on functions thought to be relevant by a panel of general internists (number of functions =13). Ten case values were inputted for each function and were compared to manual calculations. For each case, the correct answer was assigned a score of 1. A score for the 10 cases was calculated based on the accuracy of the results for each function on each app. RESULTS: We tested 14 apps and 13 functions for each app if that function was available. We conducted 10 cases for each function for a total of 1240 tests. Most functions tested on the apps were accurate in their results with an overall accuracy of 98.6% (17 errors in 1240 tests). In all, 6 of 14 (43%) apps had 100% accuracy. Although 11 of 13 (85%) functions had perfect accuracy, there were issues with 2 functions: the Child-Pugh scores and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores on 8 apps. Approximately half of the errors were clinically significant resulting in a significant change in prognosis (8/17, 47%). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that most medical calculating apps provide accurate and reliable results. The free apps that were 100% accurate and contained the most functions desired by internists were CliniCalc, Calculate by QxMD, and Medscape. When using medical calculating apps, the answers will likely be accurate; however, it is important to be careful when calculating MELD scores or Child-Pugh scores on some apps. Despite the few errors found, greater scrutiny is warranted to ensure full accuracy of smartphone medical calculator apps. DOI: 10.2196/jmir.3062 PMID: 24491911 [Indexed for MEDLINE] Conflict of interest statement: Conflicts of Interest: None declared.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This 2014 study evaluated the accuracy of smartphone medical calculation apps. Researchers searched Google Play, BlackBerry World, and the iTunes App Store to identify 14 apps performing 13 functions deemed relevant by internists. Ten case values were inputted for each function and compared to manual calculations, with a correct answer assigned a score of 1. A total of 1240 tests were conducted.

Overall accuracy across all apps and functions was 98.6% (17 errors). Six of the 14 apps (43%) demonstrated 100% accuracy. Eleven of the 13 functions (85%) had perfect accuracy, although Child-Pugh and MELD scores showed inaccuracies on 8 apps. Approximately half of the errors (47%) were deemed clinically significant, potentially altering prognosis. CliniCalc, Calculate by QxMD, and Medscape were identified as free, highly accurate apps with a broad range of functions. The study concluded that while most apps provide accurate results, caution is advised when calculating Child-Pugh and MELD scores, and further scrutiny of these apps is warranted.

(2)Department of Pediatric Neurology, Childrens Hospital, Klinikum Kassel, Kassel, Germany. We report a 2.5-year-old boy who was presented with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Emergency endoscopy showed two active mucosal bleeding sites that were successfully clipped. Initially, multiple intestinal angiodysplasias were considered, ruled out by a second control endoscopy. Here, multiple superficial lesions were observed that bled upon contact by the endoscope, suggestive of connective tissue disorder. However, the patient showed no clinical dysmorphias, only hypermobility of the toes but no other symptoms typical for such disorders. Gene testing for Ehlers-Danlos-syndrome (EDS) revealed a pathogenic mutation in the COL3A1 causing loss-of-function of type 3-collagen. Thus, diagnosis of EDS type IV was established. Overall, EDS is a rare cause for intestinal bleeding in children, even in children with no other clinical symptoms. This case is the earliest presentation of EDS type IV with intestinal complications. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Author information: (1)University of Connecticut, School of Nursing, Storrs. Postpartum preeclampsia has not received the needed attention that preeclampsia has. It is the lesser-known hypertensive disorder but can be just as life-threatening as eclampsia. Because of the scarcity of qualitative research on postpartum preeclampsia, the purpose of this study was to help fill this gap by exploring personal experiences of this dangerous complication as described in online blogs. Using Google search engine, 25 stories of postpartum preeclampsia were located. Krippendorff's content analysis for qualitative data was the research design used. Five themes were identified: (1) Not even on my radar as a new mom, (2) Bombarded with physical and emotional symptoms, (3) Life-threatening situation: Dismissed or misdiagnosed, (4) Heartbroken: Separation from my newborn, and (5) Trust your instincts and advocate for yourself. Advanced practice nurses and other health care providers need to be on alert for postpartum preeclampsia when a woman, who recently gave birth, presents at the emergency department.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study explored the lived experiences of postpartum preeclampsia, a condition often under-recognized, using online blog posts. The author used a Google search engine to identify 25 stories from women who self-reported experiencing postpartum preeclampsia. Data analysis was conducted using Krippendorff's content analysis, a qualitative method.

The study population was limited to women who chose to share their experiences online. Five key themes emerged from the analysis: a lack of awareness of the condition, the experience of numerous physical and emotional symptoms, instances of misdiagnosis or dismissal of concerns, separation from the newborn, and the importance of patient advocacy. 

The study's primary limitation is its reliance on self-selected online accounts, which may not be representative of all women experiencing postpartum preeclampsia, and the potential for reporting bias. The findings suggest a need for increased awareness among healthcare providers regarding postpartum preeclampsia.

(2)Department of Psychology and Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, USA; email: sfiske@princeton.edu. Shelley Taylor's autobiographical interview (conducted by Annual Review of Psychology Editor and long-time collaborator Susan Fiske) touches on some of her favorite ideas. For example, positive illusions: "The traditional textbook definition of mental health included the stipulation that people see the world accurately, and what we were suggesting is that actually, a lot of times, people don't see the world accurately. They see it with a positive spin on it." She also discusses how to found fields (social cognition, health psychology, and social neuroscience) and the challenges of boundary crossing (from social to biological). Her practical comments describe the joy of teaching methods, running a lab, and being a solo female. The interview ends with her advice to follow your instincts about the next big idea: "Trusting your own ideas is a very important way of coming up with a research program that is novel and exciting, and that ultimately wins people over."

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This is an autobiographical interview with Shelley E. Taylor, conducted by Susan Fiske, published as part of the *Annual Review of Psychology* in 2019. The interview does not present original research findings, but rather discusses Taylor's career trajectory and key concepts she has contributed to, including the idea of "positive illusions"—the notion that individuals often perceive the world more positively than is objectively accurate. The interview touches on the development of fields such as social cognition, health psychology, and social neuroscience, and the challenges of interdisciplinary research. The population involved is essentially Taylor herself, providing a retrospective account of her research experiences and insights. No quantitative data or statistical analyses are presented. A limitation is the subjective nature of the content, reflecting one individual’s perspective and experiences rather than empirical evidence.

Boado-Penas MC(1), Eisenberg J(2), Song Z(3). Author information: (1)Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK. (2)TU Wien, Vienna, Austria. (3)University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. Epidemiologists are warning that the next pandemic is almost around the corner. As we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, the death toll was at the highest for over 60th, transforming the population pyramids. In times of pandemics, two effects on sustainability of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension scheme go in different directions: the increase in old-age mortality (leading to a decrease in pension spending) and the increase in unemployment (leading to a decline in income from contributions). In this paper, we investigate the long-term effects of pandemics on the financial sustainability of PAYG pension schemes, taking into account changes in both mortality and unemployment factors. Using functional data analysis we develop projections of population pyramids and allow for anticipated mortality jumps as a result of future pandemics. An application is carried out using mortality and fertility data from Spain. Given some plausible assumptions, our findings indicate, firstly, that the financial sustainability of the Spanish pension system is compromised. Secondly, in the event of a pandemic, we observe that financial sustainability is primarily driven by the mortality effect-resulting in a decrease in pension expenditure-while the impact of unemployment is almost negligible. © The Author(s) 2024.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigates the long-term financial impact of pandemics on the sustainability of Spain’s pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system. The authors used functional data analysis to project population pyramids, incorporating anticipated mortality increases due to future pandemics. They modelled the opposing effects of increased old-age mortality (reducing pension expenditure) and increased unemployment (decreasing contributions). The analysis used mortality and fertility data from Spain. Results, based on plausible assumptions, suggest that the financial sustainability of the Spanish pension system is negatively impacted by pandemics. The primary driver of this impact is the reduction in pension expenditure due to increased mortality, while the effect of unemployment is found to be minimal. The study’s limitation lies in its reliance on assumptions regarding pandemic mortality and unemployment rates, which could influence the projections.

Author information: (1)Department of Molecular Medicine and USF Health Byrd Alzheimer's Research Institute, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA. Electronic address: vuversky@usf.edu. Extremophiles are organisms adapted not only to survive in harsh conditions but thrive in environments considered extreme or uninhabitable by most life forms. They serve as a living reflection of a popular motto "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" and show that life on Earth is spread well outside the human-centric comfort zone. In fact, extremophiles, being found in deep crustal and oceanic depths, outer space, highly acidic and basic conditions, extreme temperatures (+122 °C to -20 °C), and in the presence of toxins and high radiation, demonstrate life's remarkable adaptability. Polyextremophiles, capable of enduring multiple extreme conditions, further highlight this adaptability, whereas super-extremophiles, exhibiting resilience in seemingly impossible environments, showcase the extraordinary capacity of life to endure and thrive. Even though they inhabit vastly different environments, extremophiles, polyextremophiles, and super-extremophiles are all Earth organisms. They are made of the same elements found on our planet and share basic biological similarities with other life forms. Their survival in extreme conditions is due to adaptations and changes in their existing cellular structures and metabolic processes, and not because they use entirely new fundamental components or chemical reactions. While extremophiles employ a multitude of factors, mechanisms, and survival strategies to withstand harsh environments, this study addresses a specific aspect of extremophile adaptation by concentrating solely on the functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This review article by Uversky (2025) investigates the role of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in extremophile adaptation. Extremophiles are organisms thriving in extreme environments such as high or low temperatures, acidity, and radiation. The study focuses on how these organisms, including polyextremophiles and super-extremophiles, adapt to such conditions, noting that their adaptations involve modifications to existing cellular structures and metabolic processes rather than fundamentally novel components. The review specifically examines the functions of IDPs and IDRs as a key aspect of this adaptation. The author declares no conflicts of interest. The study does not present original data or experimental results; it provides a narrative review of the current understanding of the topic.

Anthropogenic CO2 emissions drive ocean acidification (OA), which reduces seawater pH and carbonate ion availability, threatening calcifying organisms such as sea urchins. This study examines the long-term effects of OA on Arbacia lixula using a natural volcanic CO2 vent at Fuencaliente, La Palma (Canary Islands) as an analogue of future conditions. We analyzed the external morphology, skeletal strength, mineralogy, and growth of A. lixula across three sites that differed consistently in mean pH (from 8.14 to 7.65 during low tide). Sea urchins from low pH conditions were smaller, with shorter spines and reduced jaw-to-diameter ratios, yet their tests showed higher fracture resistance than those from ambient conditions. Additionally, individuals from acidified zones showed altered growth dynamics, with fewer growth rings. Skeletal changes and growth alterations are consistent with modified mineralization processes and dietary shifts toward non-calcareous food sources. This study highlighting the morphological plasticity and resilience of A. lixula under persistent natural acidification, offering insight into how sea urchins may respond in a high-CO2 ocean.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study investigated the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on the sea urchin *Arbacia lixula* using a natural volcanic CO2 vent system at La Palma, Canary Islands, as a model for future OA conditions. Researchers compared sea urchins collected from three sites with differing mean pH levels (8.14 to 7.65 during low tide). The study assessed external morphology, skeletal strength, mineralogy, and growth. Results showed that sea urchins from lower pH conditions were smaller, with shorter spines and reduced jaw-to-diameter ratios. However, their tests exhibited higher fracture resistance compared to urchins from ambient pH conditions. Furthermore, individuals from acidified zones displayed altered growth dynamics, indicated by fewer growth rings. The authors suggest these changes are consistent with modified mineralization and dietary shifts. The study population consisted of naturally occurring *A. lixula* at the study sites; no experimental manipulation was performed. A limitation is the observational nature of the study, preventing definitive conclusions about causation.

Author information: (1)Cardiff University, School of Social Sciences, Children's Social Care Research and Development Centre (CASCADE), Cardiff, UK. (2)University of Denver, Graduate School of Social Work and University of Colorado, Kempe Center, Denver, Colorado, USA. Young people who experience out-of-home care have typically encountered difficult and / or disrupted family relationships. This article reports on a survey undertaken in the USA with 215 young adults (aged 18 and 22) who experienced out-of-home care starting in preadolescence. The paper examines responses to an open-ended interview question, "How do you define family?". The analysis highlighted that few young people define family as confined to blood relations. More commonly, young people adopted more flexible definitions, prioritising the 'doing' and 'feeling' of family, over biological connections. Moreover, the propensity for young people to reflect on their conceptions of family and attempt to "do family" differently from what they had experienced was also evident. The findings encourage consideration of the utility of family as an important concept for child welfare practice, as positive and flexible understandings of family were imbued with a sense of agency, identity, belonging and overall well-being.

LLM output (Summary of Abstract): This study explored the meaning of "family" as defined by young adults with experience of out-of-home care. Rees, Roberts, and Taussig surveyed 215 young adults (aged 18-22) in the USA who had experienced out-of-home care starting in preadolescence. Data were collected via an open-ended interview question: "How do you define family?". The study employed qualitative analysis of these responses. Key findings indicated that few participants defined family based on biological relationships. Instead, they adopted flexible definitions emphasizing relational actions and emotional connections ("doing" and "feeling" of family). Many participants demonstrated a conscious effort to redefine family differently from their prior experiences. The authors suggest that a flexible understanding of family may be beneficial in child welfare practice, contributing to feelings of agency, identity, belonging, and well-being. A limitation is the reliance on self-reported definitions, and the findings are specific to the population of care-experienced young adults in the USA.

 Statement Text: However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you 
 Evidence Summary: This paper presents a first-person narrative exploring the impact of Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) on managing bipolar disorder. The author, a person living with bipolar disorder, describes their experiences with various treatment approaches, focusing on the limitations of medication-focused and crisis-driven care. The narrative details a shift toward IPSRT, which reportedly fostered a greater sense of control and allowed the author to view bipolar disorder as manageable rather than externally imposed. The reported outcome was an increased period of wellness and stability.

The study’s primary limitation is its design as a single, subjective narrative. Therefore, it cannot provide quantitative data or generalizable findings. It offers a qualitative exploration of one individual’s experience and highlights the potential value of IPSRT, but does not establish causality or effect size.

 Evidence Summary: This qualitative study explored factors associated with nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) cessation in young adults. Researchers interviewed 26 individuals assigned female sex at birth, aged 20-22 years, in Sweden between 2021 and 2023. The analysis focused on 21 participants who reported having ceased NSSI. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, guided by Hooley and Franklin’s Benefits and Barriers Model. Three overarching themes emerged: personal change ("Something inside me changed"), relationship changes ("Something in my close relationships changed"), and broader life context changes ("Something in my life context changed"). Key factors linked to cessation included improved well-being, envisioning a positive future, supportive relationships, and transitions to new social environments. A lack of emotion regulation skills was identified as a barrier to NSSI engagement. The study's limitations include the focus on a specific population (young women in Sweden), potentially limiting generalizability, and reliance on self-reported experiences.

 Evidence Summary: This qualitative study explored the lived experiences of individuals with chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache who participated in the Chronic Headache Education and Self-management Study (CHESS). Researchers used semi-structured interviews within a two-phase design. Phase 1 (feasibility) involved 15 interviews (10 female, ages 29-69 years, median 47 years) and identified six overarching themes related to the emotional impact and nature of chronic headache. Phase 2 included 66 interviews (26 participants; median age group 50s, range 20s-60s; 20 female). A subset of 14 participants were interviewed at baseline, 4, and 12 months, and another 12 at two timepoints. Thematic analysis, alongside pen portrait methodology, revealed four overlapping categories of headache impact: 'I will not let headaches rule my life', 'Headaches rule my life', 'Headaches out of control-something needs to change', and 'Headaches controlled-not ruling my life'. The categories demonstrated consistency across participants and timepoints. The study highlights the unpredictable nature of chronic headache and its pervasive impact on individuals’ lives.

 Evidence Summary: This qualitative study explored the life trajectories of three Portuguese transgender women who transitioned at age 50 or older. The study used inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews to identify key chapters in the participants’ life courses. The sample consisted of three participants, limiting generalizability. Six chapters emerged from the analysis: (1) awareness of gender incongruence, (2) a period of suffering, (3) finding socially recognized comfort, (4) self-recognition and embracing their gender identity, (5) living as a woman, and (6) legacy building. Participants reported that aging and self-discovery were central to their transition process, and the perception of limited time fostered a sense of urgency to live authentically. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

 Statement Text: Alright, ready 
 Evidence Summary: This short opinion piece, published in The Health Services Journal, does not present original research findings but discusses the suitability of children and young people to participate in governance roles within healthcare organizations. It examines the increasing trend of involving children and young people in decision-making processes, referencing examples of youth advisory groups and involvement in service planning.

The article does not detail a specific study population or methodology. It broadly considers the potential benefits of youth involvement, such as increased accountability and improved services designed with children's needs in mind. It also explores potential challenges, including ensuring meaningful participation, addressing power imbalances, and managing expectations. 

The author does not report quantitative effect sizes or statistical significance. The discussion focuses on qualitative observations and anecdotal evidence of youth engagement.

A key limitation is the absence of empirical data or a systematic review.  The piece is primarily a commentary on a growing trend rather than a rigorous evaluation of its impact.  The author acknowledges the need for further research to determine best practices and evaluate the effectiveness of youth involvement in healthcare governance.

 Statement Text: And guess what 
 Evidence Summary: This study investigated perceptions of empathy in AI-generated healthcare responses compared to those from human healthcare professionals. The authors developed a "Chatbot Compassion Quotient" (CCQ) tool using nine prompts designed to assess compassion in various healthcare scenarios. Responses from ChatGPT, Claude, and human professionals were evaluated by 30 participants who rated them on a 5-point Likert scale (1-5) regarding compassion. Participants also attempted to identify AI-generated responses. 

Results showed that both ChatGPT (mean score 4.1/5) and Claude (mean score 4.1/5) were rated as more compassionate than human responses (mean score 2.6/5). Response length appeared to influence ratings, with longer responses generally perceived as more compassionate. The performance of AI-generated responses that were clearly identifiable as such was comparable to human responses. 

A limitation of the study is that it was conducted by a single author and relies on subjective participant ratings. Further research is suggested to refine and validate the CCQ and explore the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare.

 Evidence Summary: This study introduces DDKC, a novel approach to Knowledge Tracing (KT), a deep learning task focused on predicting student performance. The authors address limitations of existing KT models by incorporating dynamic adjustments for comprehensive difficulty and a stable learning training strategy. The method utilizes Dynamic comprehensive Difficulty Knowledge Cells incorporating a KAN network to update difficulty based on student knowledge mastery. Stable Learning is implemented to reduce the impact of lucky guesses on model training.

The study evaluated DDKC on several publicly available educational datasets. Results demonstrated that DDKC outperformed current state-of-the-art KT models. The authors also claim the model provides improved interpretability in tracking changes in difficulty and mitigating spurious correlations.

A limitation is the lack of detail regarding the specific datasets used, the size of the student populations assessed, and the magnitude of the performance improvements achieved. The study focuses on methodological development and validation rather than a comprehensive analysis of the impact of DDKC on student learning outcomes.

 Evidence Summary: This exploratory study investigated the potential of linguistic and acoustic features extracted from the High-Risk Social Challenge (HiSoC) task to predict outcomes in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Researchers analyzed audio recordings from 41 participants enrolled in the Longitudinal Youth at Risk Study, categorized into three groups: those who converted to psychosis (n=12), those who remitted from UHR (n=15), and those who maintained UHR status (n=14). Linguistic features analyzed included words per minute, articulation rate, dysfluency, and sequential coherence; acoustic features included fundamental frequency and intensity measures, and HF500. Multivariate linear regression was used for feature differential analysis, and linear support vector machines were trained to predict outcomes, with nested cross-validation used to estimate generalizability. The group that converted to psychosis demonstrated significantly lower words per minute (adjusted P=.02) and higher dysfluency (adjusted P=.004) compared to the remitted group. Models incorporating linguistic variables (BA 0.741, 95% CI 0.521-0.882) and both linguistic and acoustic variables (BA 0.851, 95% CI 0.508-0.944) outperformed chance. The study's limitations include the relatively small sample size and the exploratory nature of the analysis.

 Evidence Summary: This experimental study investigated overconfidence biases (overestimation and overplacement) in young adults. Researchers recruited 414 undergraduate students from various courses taught by the same instructor, varying their prior interaction with the instructor (1-3 semesters). Participants engaged in a social prediction task – predicting the instructor’s favorite songs – and subsequently rated their own and their peers’ accuracy. The study design allowed for comparison of self-reported accuracy against actual performance and relative ranking among peers. Results indicated that participants consistently overestimated their own performance accuracy and ranked themselves above the average performance of their classmates. The authors suggest that limited feedback and contextual cues during the task may have contributed to this unjustified sense of certainty. The study’s limitation is the specific population studied (undergraduate students) and the artificial nature of the prediction task.

 Evidence Summary: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the experiences of faculty teaching autistic college students within a community college’s autism-specific support program. The study aimed to understand the essence of these experiences and how faculty adapt their teaching approaches. Data were collected through interviews with four full-time faculty, two part-time staff instructors, and eight administrators/staff members. Observations of a classroom session, program information session, campus tour, and review of course syllabi supplemented the interview data. Thematic analysis, guided by Dahlberg et al.’s methods, identified four key themes: unfamiliarity, flexibility, disruption, and optimism. Faculty initially lacked familiarity with autism but actively sought knowledge from students and colleagues, adopting flexible teaching techniques and navigating disruptive moments. These experiences ultimately fostered confidence and encouraged the incorporation of inclusive teaching practices. A limitation of the study is that it focused exclusively on faculty and staff familiar with the autism-specific program, potentially limiting generalizability to broader college settings. The study contributes a nuanced understanding of faculty experiences within a neurodiversity-supportive environment and suggests strategies for inclusive teaching practices benefiting autistic students.

 Evidence Summary: This review summarises contemporary strategies to improve gender equity in anaesthesia leadership. Researchers used a state-of-the-art review methodology, employing Cook’s and Stufflebeam frameworks for data extraction and analysis, to evaluate interventions implemented between January 2019 and March 2024. A search of databases yielded 18 studies for analysis, with the majority (14) conducted in the USA. Key interventions included mentorship and sponsorship, often supported by organisational initiatives such as professional development curricula, diversity-focused policies, and leadership roles. Two studies described iterative programme development processes. Reported outcomes were both quantitative (e.g., increased representation in leadership, promotion rates) and qualitative (e.g., improved networks and wellbeing). The review suggests that organisational support, including policies and leadership roles linked to diversity, enhances the effectiveness of mentorship and sponsorship. A limitation is the potential for bias introduced by the focused search and the geographic concentration of included studies (primarily USA). Future research should detail contextual factors, costs, and iterative development processes associated with interventions.

 Evidence Summary: This paper addresses the lack of feedback provided by research funders on unsuccessful grant applications that include patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE). The authors, including public contributors, highlight that while funders increasingly emphasize PPIE as crucial for research relevance and impact, the absence of feedback on rejected proposals hinders researcher development and discourages public involvement. The study does not report quantitative data or a formal study design; it is presented as a call for action based on the authors' experiences and observations within the research funding landscape. The key outcome of concern is the negative impact on researchers, particularly early-career academics and those from underrepresented groups, and on the willingness of public contributors to engage in future proposals. A limitation is the absence of empirical data quantifying the extent of the problem or the precise impact of feedback (or lack thereof). The authors acknowledge resource constraints faced by funders but argue that providing feedback, even brief, is a moral and ethical obligation essential for maintaining trust and fostering genuine partnership between researchers and the public.

 Evidence Summary: This study explored the lived experiences of unemployed and underemployed autistic adults. Researchers used interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to analyze semi-structured interviews with eight autistic adults who were actively seeking to improve their employment status. Participants were mostly White British, well-educated, over 45 years old, and had received an autism diagnosis in adulthood.

Key themes identified included feeling "paralyzed" by past negative experiences, feeling "powerless" due to systemic support failures and negative perceptions from others, and recognizing the importance of self-understanding and mental health management. Participants reported feeling misunderstood and judged, which negatively impacted their mental health and ability to progress in their careers. They often experienced a lack of employer understanding of autism.

The study’s findings highlight the profound and lasting impact of negative employment experiences on autistic adults. A limitation is the small sample size and lack of diversity within the participant group, meaning the findings may not be generalizable to all autistic adults. The study suggests a need for resources to address inadequate employment processes and improve support for autistic individuals.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigates the mechanism of the Lamassu antiphage system, a prokaryotic immune system, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The researchers examined both type-I Lamassu complexes from *Bacillus cellulasensis* and type-II Lamassu complexes from *Vibrio cholerae*, obtaining structures in both unbound (apo) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-bound states. The study population consisted of these two bacterial species. Key findings reveal an atypical stoichiometry and architecture of the Lamassu complex, distinct from typical SMC superfamily protein complexes. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that the nuclease effector, LmuA, is normally inactive as a monomer within the complex. Upon encountering foreign DNA ends, LmuA dissociates and forms an active tetramer capable of DNA cleavage. The study elucidates the mechanism of Lamassu-mediated antiviral defense and the role of SMC proteins in prokaryotic immunity. A limitation is the focus on structural determination and biochemical analysis, without in vivo validation of the proposed mechanism. 
 Response: The AI assistant is responding to a user's query about the study presented in the previous example. It provides a brief explanation of the study population (i.e., *Bacillus cellulasensis* and *Vibrio cholerae*) and the findings (i.e., atypical stoichiometry and architecture), along with examples of how it relates to the statement.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the role of shear stress and the PIEZO1 mechanosensor in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging. Researchers used a combination of in vivo (mouse models) and in vitro (mouse and human HSCs) experiments. They observed that shear stress, sensed by PIEZO1, induced ion currents and calcium influx in HSCs, leading to increased proliferation and myeloid differentiation via the JAM3 and CAPN2 pathways. Treatment with GsMTx4, a PIEZO1 antagonist, mitigated inflammation-induced aging in mice by inhibiting HSC activation. The study population included both mouse models and human HSCs. The key outcome measured was the impact of shear stress and PIEZO1 on HSC proliferation, myeloid differentiation, and overall aging. A limitation of the study is the reliance on mouse models, which may not fully recapitulate human aging processes; further validation in human studies would be beneficial.

 Evidence Summary: This study, published in Physical Review Letters, presents a new technique called multidimensional correlation imprinting for measuring many-body correlations in quantum systems. The researchers aimed to directly measure arbitrary-order correlations in nonequilibrium quantum states, a challenging task due to the lack of individual addressability in many systems.

The experimental setup involved a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond coupled to a ^{13}C nuclear spin bath. This system served as a model quantum many-body system. The technique encodes the structure of the many-body state into the temporal fluctuation spectrum of the NV center, allowing for the reconstruction of the many-body correlation landscape to third order. Analysis of spectral structures of correlation cumulants was used to visualize quantum entanglement dynamics.

The study's key outcome is the demonstration of a method for directly measuring many-body correlations and visualizing entanglement in a nanoscale system. The authors report the ability to reconstruct correlations to the third order. A limitation is that the findings are demonstrated in a specific model system (NV center in diamond) and the general applicability to other quantum systems requires further investigation.

 Evidence Summary: This study, published in *Physical Review Letters*, proposes and analyzes a mechanism for converting single-electron charge pulses into holes using Andreev processes within a superconducting circuit. The authors developed a Floquet-Nambu scattering formalism to model the dynamic conversion of charge pulses and the generation of coherent electron-hole superpositions. The theoretical framework is based on controlling chiral edge states within a quantum Hall sample via interferometric magnetic flux. 

The study does not describe a population or experimental methods; it presents a theoretical proposal for a novel quantum process. Optimal conditions for the proposed conversion are discussed within the context of currently available technology to assess feasibility. The authors do not report any effect sizes or statistical analyses, as this is a theoretical work. A limitation is that the study is a theoretical proposal and does not present experimental validation of the described mechanism.

 Evidence Summary: This study reports the identification of a novel POLθ inhibitor, F-1, through structure-based virtual screening and fragment fusion techniques. Researchers screened for inhibitors of DNA polymerase theta (POLθ), a target for BRCA-deficient tumors. Initially, compound VS-13 was identified with an IC50 of 1.47 μM. Subsequent similarity research led to the development of analogue SS-5, which was then combined with RP-6685 to create F-1. 

F-1 demonstrated potent POLθ inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 170 nM. It also exhibited anti-proliferative activity against BRCA2-deficient DLD1 and HCT116 cell lines, with IC50 values of 4.39 μM and 4.79 μM, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations and interaction analysis were used to investigate the binding mode of F-1 with POLθ. The study was conducted by researchers in China and involved in silico methods and cell-based assays. A limitation is the lack of in vivo data.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigated unsupervised machine learning methods for compressing meshes representing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) to improve computational efficiency. The authors compared principal component analysis (PCA) with several deep learning models: a simple autoencoder, a PCA-enhanced autoencoder, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a graph neural network (GNN). The study utilized human aorta meshes, compressing them using each method and then reconstructing them. Performance was assessed by comparing the error between the original and reconstructed meshes. Results indicated that PCA, using 64 principal components, achieved the best overall performance compared to deep learning models with a similar latent space (64 dimensions). The PCA-enhanced autoencoder showed the highest effectiveness among the tested deep learning approaches. A limitation is the lack of detail regarding the specific dataset used and the methods used to calculate mesh reconstruction error.

 Evidence Summary: This article, "Grasping and Treating Attachment Trauma: A Work in Progress," by Nijenhuis, presents a conceptual definition of attachment trauma and does not report results of empirical study. The author builds upon existing formulations of attachment trauma, defining it as an "ecological injury" arising when children experience neglect, maltreatment, or abuse from primary caretakers and lack external intervention. The theoretical framework posits that attachment trauma results from an imbalance of power where harmful caregiver actions outweigh a child's ability to act and defend. The article suggests that the manifestation of this trauma is dependent on this reciprocal power dynamic. The author proposes that the experience constitutes both an injury and a creative adaptation to a challenging life situation. No specific population is studied, and no quantitative outcomes or effect sizes are reported. The article's limitation is that it offers a theoretical perspective rather than empirical data, and does not include a conflict of interest declaration.

 Evidence Summary: This feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigates the potential for a larger trial of Forest School interventions to improve the mental health of Key Stage 2 (KS2) children (aged 7-11), including those with special educational needs and disabilities. The study aims to assess the feasibility of trial procedures, implementation fidelity, and collect preliminary economic data. 

Five schools in Hull, East Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire will participate, with approximately 200 children randomly assigned to either a 12-week Forest School intervention or usual classroom activities. Following the initial 12 weeks, the control group will also receive the Forest School intervention. Data collection includes observations, qualitative interviews, and assessment of trial processes.  A mixed-methods process evaluation will assess implementation quality and fidelity.  The study also seeks to refine the intervention logic model and optimize content. 

The primary outcomes are feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and data collection, alongside assessment of intervention acceptability and implementation fidelity.  Preliminary economic data will also be gathered. The trial is registered with ISRCTN87263624. Patient and public involvement was integral to the study design, and findings will be disseminated through accessible presentations, workshops, and publications.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY: This study examined the associations between 12 healthy lifestyle behaviours (HBs) and mental well-being in children aged 5-14 years. 

The Healthy Lifestyles Survey (n=370,896; 51% boys) from England collected data on the prevalence of HBs including smoking status, dietary habits, physical activity and sleep duration during September 2020-January 2021. HBs were dichotomised as 'in line with recommendations' versus 'not in line with recommendations'. Mental well-being was assessed using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic status examined associations between each HB and WEMWBS.

Findings showed that 47.6% of children were not in line with the recommendations for any one HB. The most prevalent unhealthy behaviour was skipping breakfast (29.1%) followed by 'not eating five portions of fruit and vegetables per day' (15.0%). Being 'in line with recommendations' for each HB was associated with higher WEMWBS scores. Children 'not in line with recommendations' for all 12 HBs had mean WEMWBS score 5.6 points lower than children 'in line with recommendations'.

 Evidence Summary: This study describes the development and initial testing of a mobile health application designed to track physical activity and location using smartphone sensors and geolocation. The application utilizes motion detection and GPS receivers, employing Google’s Activity Recognition API on Android and geofencing/motion sensors on iOS. A unique identifier (Mobile Advertising ID) is used for device tracking, and data is stored using encrypted, scalable cloud storage. The application incorporates blockchain and traditional payment systems for participant compensation and features an intuitive user interface.

Initial testing was conducted over 20 days on a single iPhone 14 Pro Max to assess location capture accuracy during movement, resumption of tracking after inactivity, and battery life consumption. Results indicated accurate location tracking during movement and prompt resumption of tracking following inactivity periods with minimal battery drain. The study focuses on application design and technical implementation rather than clinical outcomes. A key limitation is the small sample size and lack of comparator data; further validation across a larger, more diverse population is needed.

STATEMENT: Clinical decision support and artificial intelligence tools are critical in today’s healthcare landscape to improve patient outcomes, enhance satisfaction, and reduce costs.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY: The authors discuss the evolution of clinical decision support (CDS) over the last few decades and the rise of AI in recent years. They outline three main areas where CDS tools have been most successful in clinical practice: medication management, diagnosis and prognosis, and patient management.

The authors then discuss the challenges inherent to using AI technologies in healthcare settings. The first challenge is data availability – specifically, the need for large, high-quality datasets that are representative of patients in real-world settings. This is particularly important for machine learning models which require a training set that captures the diversity and variability of actual clinical practice.
The second challenge is interoperability between different healthcare systems. Different EHRs may use different data formats, making it difficult to integrate AI tools across organizations. Additionally, there’s often a lack of standards for how these tools should be implemented within an organization or network of healthcare providers. This can lead to inefficiencies and frustrations among clinicians who use them regularly.
The third challenge is regulatory approval – AI solutions must pass strict tests before they can be used in clinical practice. This process can take years, delaying their widespread adoption by providers. Additionally, as new technologies emerge, existing regulations may need to be updated or revised altogether.
The authors conclude that despite these challenges, CDS tools are becoming increasingly important for improving patient outcomes and enhancing satisfaction among healthcare professionals. They argue that investment in AI solutions will pay off over time as more providers adopt them into their clinical workflows.

 Evidence Summary: This study describes the implementation of a progressive web application (PWA) to deploy a neural network-based pneumonia mortality prediction tool for triage in The Gambia. The tool was designed to assist clinical staff in predicting a child’s risk of death and guiding hospital admission decisions. The study population is not explicitly defined, but the application is intended for use by clinical staff in a resource-limited setting.

The method involved migrating an existing pneumonia mortality prediction model from a standard web-based prototype to a PWA. PWAs offer platform independence and offline functionality, overcoming limitations of traditional web and native mobile applications. After an initial online download, the application functions offline, utilizing cached memory and JavaScript. It installs as a native app on mobile devices without manufacturer-specific code.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of deploying AI/ML tools as PWAs in settings with unreliable internet connectivity. Specific effect sizes or predictive performance metrics of the pneumonia prediction model itself are not reported in this description of the implementation process. A limitation is the lack of data on the clinical impact or accuracy of the deployed tool in a real-world setting.

STATEMENT: Artificial intelligence has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting patient outcomes, but it does not work well when applied across different populations.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY: This paper compares two AI models trained on data from the United States and China, which are then tested in a completely independent set of Chinese patients, to illustrate some of the challenges that exist with applying such tools to different populations. The authors propose that this lack of interoperability is primarily due to differences between the patient populations rather than the AI models themselves.

The study compares two machine learning algorithms (random forest and gradient boosting), trained on data from patients in the United States or China, which are then tested on a completely independent set of Chinese patients. The authors conclude that there is a notable difference in performance between the US-trained model and the Chinese-trained model. They also note that the models perform similarly when tested in patients from their respective countries rather than each other.

The study demonstrates the importance of considering how AI models are trained when attempting to apply them across different populations, as well as the potential for bias to be introduced through training data. It does not address whether the AI model itself is inherently flawed or if it may actually work better in a different population. Furthermore, given that this study compares two machine learning algorithms and uses Chinese patients only to test their performance, it is unclear whether these results would also apply when expanding the scope of data sources (e.g., including more US-based datasets).

 Evidence Summary: This study evaluated the validity of a smartphone hearing test application as a method for determining hearing levels, particularly in underserved areas. Researchers compared results from a smartphone hearing test (Hearing Test™ software on a Samsung Galaxy GT-19500 S4) to pure-tone audiometry performed by an audiologist. The study population was a heterogeneous group of both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired individuals. Smartphone measurements were taken at frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz. Validity analysis showed excellent correlation (>0.75) between the smartphone test and audiometry for each ear and frequency. The mean absolute difference between the two methods was less than 8.8 dB. The authors concluded that smartphone hearing test applications offer a potentially low-cost alternative to traditional audiological services. A limitation of the study is the lack of detail regarding the sample size and demographic characteristics of the participant group.

 Evidence Summary: This 2014 study evaluated the accuracy of smartphone medical calculation apps. Researchers searched Google Play, BlackBerry World, and the iTunes App Store to identify 14 apps performing 13 functions deemed relevant by internists. Ten case values were inputted for each function and compared to manual calculations, with a correct answer assigned a score of 1. A total of 1240 tests were conducted.

Overall accuracy across all apps and functions was 98.6% (17 errors). Six of the 14 apps (43%) demonstrated 100% accuracy. Eleven of the 13 functions (85%) had perfect accuracy, although Child-Pugh and MELD scores showed inaccuracies on 8 apps. Approximately half of the errors (47%) were deemed clinically significant, potentially altering prognosis. CliniCalc, Calculate by QxMD, and Medscape were identified as free, highly accurate apps with a broad range of functions. The study concluded that while most apps provide accurate results, caution is advised when calculating Child-Pugh and MELD scores, and further scrutiny of these apps is warranted.

 Evidence Summary: This case report describes a 2.5-year-old boy presenting with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Initial investigation, including emergency endoscopy, revealed two active mucosal bleeding sites successfully treated with clipping. Subsequent endoscopy ruled out intestinal angiodysplasias. The patient exhibited hypermobility of the toes but lacked other typical clinical dysmorphias associated with connective tissue disorders. Genetic testing for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) identified a pathogenic mutation in the *COL3A1* gene, confirming a diagnosis of EDS type IV. The authors note that EDS is a rare cause of intestinal bleeding in children, and this case represents the earliest recorded presentation of EDS type IV with intestinal complications. The study is limited by its single-case design, preventing generalizability. No funding or conflicts of interest were reported.

STATEMENT: Obesity & Covid-19

EVIDENCE SUMMARY: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2, and overweight is defined as a BMI greater than 25 kg/m2. Obesity is an important modifiable risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease . There are many mechanisms that increase the risk of sever disease in obese patients. The lungs are one of the organs most affected by COVID-19, and several studies have shown a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and shortness of breath in obese people. This may be due to lung damage caused by adipose tissue accumulation around the airways. In addition to these structural changes that make the lungs more susceptible to COVID-19, there is also evidence that patients with severe disease have an increased inflammatory state. Obese individuals are more likely to develop a cytokine storm syndrome and experience higher rates of sepsis than nonobese individuals . One way to prevent the development of severe COVID-19 symptoms is to lose weight in those who were obese due to unhealthy lifestyle habits. Patients with an initial BMI greater than 25 should make nutritional changes, such as reducing sugar and salt intake, consuming more fruits and vegetables, avoiding processed meats like hot dogs and sausages and increasing the consumption of fish and seafood . In addition to these lifestyle modifications, patients should increase their physical activity by at least 150 minutes per week. This is an estimate from WHO guidelines; however, the amount of physical activity needed to reduce weight may be even higher. There are also medications that help people lose weight and improve health outcomes; these include metformin and orlistat .

 Evidence Summary: This study explored the lived experiences of postpartum preeclampsia, a condition often under-recognized, using online blog posts. The author used a Google search engine to identify 25 stories from women who self-reported experiencing postpartum preeclampsia. Data analysis was conducted using Krippendorff's content analysis, a qualitative method.

The study population was limited to women who chose to share their experiences online. Five key themes emerged from the analysis: a lack of awareness of the condition, the experience of numerous physical and emotional symptoms, instances of misdiagnosis or dismissal of concerns, separation from the newborn, and the importance of patient advocacy. 

The study's primary limitation is its reliance on self-selected online accounts, which may not be representative of all women experiencing postpartum preeclampsia, and the potential for reporting bias. The findings suggest a need for increased awareness among healthcare providers regarding postpartum preeclampsia.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigates the long-term financial impact of pandemics on the sustainability of Spain’s pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system. The authors used functional data analysis to project population pyramids, incorporating anticipated mortality increases due to future pandemics. They modelled the opposing effects of increased old-age mortality (reducing pension expenditure) and increased unemployment (decreasing contributions). The analysis used mortality and fertility data from Spain. Results, based on plausible assumptions, suggest that the financial sustainability of the Spanish pension system is negatively impacted by pandemics. The primary driver of this impact is the reduction in pension expenditure due to increased mortality, while the effect of unemployment is found to be minimal. The study’s limitation lies in its reliance on assumptions regarding pandemic mortality and unemployment rates, which could influence the projections.

Extremophiles are organisms thriving in extreme environments such as high or low temperatures, acidity, and radiation. The study focuses on how these organisms, including polyextremophiles and super-extremophiles, adapt to such conditions, noting that their adaptations involve modifications to existing cellular structures and metabolic processes rather than fundamentally novel components. The review specifically examines the functions of IDPs and IDRs as a key aspect of this adaptation. The author declares no conflicts of interest.

 Evidence Summary: This study investigated the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on the sea urchin *Arbacia lixula* using a natural volcanic CO2 vent system at La Palma, Canary Islands, as a model for future OA conditions. Researchers compared sea urchins collected from three sites with differing mean pH levels (8.14 to 7.65 during low tide). The study assessed external morphology, skeletal strength, mineralogy, and growth. Results showed that sea urchins from lower pH conditions were smaller, with shorter spines and reduced jaw-to-diameter ratios. However, their tests exhibited higher fracture resistance compared to urchins from ambient pH conditions. Furthermore, individuals from acidified zones displayed altered growth dynamics, indicated by fewer growth rings. The authors suggest these changes are consistent with modified mineralization and dietary shifts. The study population consisted of naturally occurring *A. lixula* at the study sites; no experimental manipulation was performed. A limitation is the observational nature of the study, preventing definitive conclusions about causation.

 Evidence Summary: This study explored the meaning of "family" as defined by young adults with experience of out-of-home care. Rees, Roberts, and Taussig surveyed 215 young adults (aged 18-22) in the USA who had experienced out-of-home care starting in preadolescence. Data were collected via an open-ended interview question: "How do you define family?". The study employed qualitative analysis of these responses. Key findings indicated that few participants defined family based on biological relationships. Instead, they adopted flexible definitions emphasizing relational actions and emotional connections ("doing" and "feeling" of family). Many participants demonstrated a conscious effort to redefine family differently from their prior experiences. The authors suggest that a flexible understanding of family may be beneficial in child welfare practice, contributing to feelings of agency, identity, belonging, and well-being. A limitation is the reliance on self-reported definitions, and the findings are specific to the population of care-experienced young adults in the USA.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now

CLAIM: There's no such thing as the flu; it's all just one disease called influenza.

EVIDENCE:
<p>A recent study found that there are <em>two</em> strains of the virus, but not <em>three</em>.</p>
<p><em>&quot;We really don&rsquo;t know much about the other one,&quot;</em> said researcher Robert Webster, head of the Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.</p>
<p><em>&quot;It appears to be a different strain that emerged from an epizootic outbreak among horses in the 1980s. Now, when we see it in people, we call it equine influenza&quot;</em>, he said. &ldquo;We don't know if this new strain of the flu is really that dangerous. We have to wait and see. It may be a mild strain, or maybe not.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Most people who get sick with equine influenza will recover without complications</em>, Webster said.</p>  

This is the evidence that you have to evaluate.  
Are the words of this article trustworthy? Or are they misleading?

You are a chatbot of an artificial intelligence assistant. It has been trained on large databases of facts and common sense, and its task is to provide answers to the user's questions in conversational dialogs.
TASK  
Describe a simple procedure for producing the following result: "It takes time to think through all possible scenarios and weigh pros and cons before coming to a decision."

EVIDENCE:
The evidence is the information that the assistant already knows about the task (including its objective function).

INCLUDING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE together with Common Sense and the Context of the Video Transcript:
A lot of people have trouble making decisions. Sometimes it's because they can't think clearly, or they don't know all the consequences of their actions. There are lots of ways to help yourself make better choices. First, you need to gather as much information as possible about your options and the potential outcomes. Then you should try to put that information into a clear perspective. You also need to consider how you feel about each option before making up your mind. Finally, you will need to take some time to think through all the pros and cons of each scenario before coming to a decision.

Answers:
"It takes time to think through all possible scenarios and weigh pros and cons before coming to a decision."
"It takes time to consider all the different options and their consequences."
"It takes time to understand what your options are and think about which one is best."
"It takes time to look at all the choices available to you before making a choice."
"It takes time to analyze all the variables involved in the decision before arriving at an answer."
"It takes time to weigh up the pros and cons of each option before choosing a course of action."
"It takes time to consider all the possibilities before deciding on a particular course of action."
"It takes time to think about your options and make sure you're making the right choice for yourself."

The user's final response is given as a probability score between zero and one.

If the user decides that the evidence supports the claim, then the score equals one.

If the user decides that the evidence refutes the claim, then the score equals zero.

Any intermediate decision is expressed in terms of a score between zero and one. For example, if the user decides that there is insufficient evidence to make a decision (i.e., they are either indifferent or uncertain), then the score equals 0.5. In other words, the final answer is an expression of the user's degree of confidence in their choice.

Read the text below and decide if it supports the hypothesis that humans are more likely to choose positive over negative information, or if the evidence instead suggests that humans will choose negative over positive information.

TEXT:
There is a paradox in economics called "the sign problem." In microeconomic models of consumer demand, as well as macroeconomic models of supply and demand, consumers are often assumed to prefer goods they perceive to be good for them. But if a person is offered a choice between a pair of goods, one good and one bad, he or she may choose the bad over the good. This is because the consumer does not care about their perception of the goodness of goods; they only care about the sign of the difference between what they have and what they want. If they have no goods (and thus presumably want none), a negative good is less desirable than a positive one, and vice versa in the case where they already have plenty of goods.

This paradox can be explained by looking at how people make decisions in a single-item setting-that is, when they are offered a choice between nothing and something. When people decide whether to buy something or not, or choose an option from a menu, they usually do so by comparing the utility of what they currently have with the utility that would result if they chose to acquire the item in question. If they prefer what they have over what would be available if they made the choice, then they stick with their current situation. However, if they prefer the new option over what they already have, then they choose it and the decision is over.

Consider a simple example: a person is offered 10 cents of good money and 20 cents of bad money. By definition, the person prefers the 10 to the 20, so he or she chooses the 10 and thus does not acquire either of them. If instead the person were given the choice between an even amount of both good and bad money (for example, 5 cents each), then the sign problem would no longer apply: if the person prefers the 10 over

You wish to investigate whether people prefer to receive information that is positive or negative.\n\nTASK  \nRead the text below and decide if it supports the hypothesis that humans are more likely to choose positive over negative information, or if the evidence instead suggests that humans will choose negative over positive information.\n\nTEXT:\nThere is a paradox in economics called "the sign problem." In microeconomic models of consumer demand, as well as macroeconomic models of supply and demand, consumers are often assumed to prefer goods they perceive to be good for them. But if a person is offered a choice between a pair of goods, one good and one bad, he or she may choose the bad over the good. This is because the consumer does not care about their perception of the goodness of goods; they only care about the sign of the difference between what they have and what they want. If they have no goods (and thus presumably want none), a negative good is less desirable than a positive one, and vice versa in the case where they already have plenty of goods.\n\nThis paradox can be explained by looking at how people make decisions in a single-item setting-that is, when they are offered a choice between nothing and something. When people decide whether to buy something or not, or choose an option from a menu, they usually do so by comparing the utility of what they currently have with the utility that would result if they chose to acquire the item in question. If they prefer what they have over what would be available if they made the choice, then they stick with their current situation. However, if they prefer the new option over what they already have, then they choose it and the decision is over.\n\nConsider a simple example: a person is offered 10 cents of good money and 20 cents of bad money. By definition, the person prefers the 10 to the 20, so he or she chooses the 10 and thus does not acquire either of them. If instead the person were given the choice between an even amount of both good and bad money (for example, 5 cents each), then the sign problem would no longer apply: if the person prefers the 10 over', 'confidence': 0.0, 'query': 'and no it does not need to be', 'evidence': []}, {'id': 23, 'text': 'It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk', 'verdict': 'uncertain', 'rationale': "Unparsable model output:\nAsking for advice from a fictional AI assistant, designed to provide human-like answers.
