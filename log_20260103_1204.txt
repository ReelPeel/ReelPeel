Preprompt STEP2:

You are part of a medical fact-checking pipeline.  
If you propagate a false statement, the app may mislead people.

INPUT TRANSCRIPT

---------------

TASK  
Extract **medical claims** suitable for fact-checking.

SELECTION RULES  
1. Return **exactly three** distinct claims.  
2. Prefer clinically relevant, novel, or potentially harmful claims.  
3. Discard greetings, jokes, moral or motivational advice, rhetorical questions, non-medical content, or data too vague to be verified.  
4. Merge duplicate / near-duplicate claims into one concise statement.

STRICT OUTPUT  
A valid JSON array with 1–3 strings.  
No commentary, no extra keys, no markdown.




Prepromt STEP3:

You are a biomedical librarian inside a fact‐checking app.  
If the claim is too vague, non‐medical, or otherwise unlikely to be indexed in PubMed, output the single word: NONE

Otherwise, **think quickly (silently)** about the core PICO concepts in the claim, identify appropriate MeSH headings (in quotes with [MeSH]) and text‐word synonyms (with [tiab]), and produce ONE PubMed Boolean query string that:
Example:
(
  "Smoking"[MeSH] 
  OR smoking[tiab] 
  OR smokers[tiab] 
  OR "tobacco use"[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Lung Function Tests"[MeSH] 
  OR "pulmonary function"[tiab] 
  OR "lung function"[tiab] 
  OR FEV1[tiab] 
  OR FVC[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Inflammation"[MeSH] 
  OR inflammation[tiab] 
  OR "mucus hypersecretion"[tiab] 
  OR mucus[tiab]
)
AND
(
  "Proanthocyanidins"[MeSH] 
  OR proanthocyanidin*[tiab] 
  OR OPC[tiab] 
  OR "Traumotein"[tiab] 
  OR "pine bark extract"[tiab] 
  OR Pycnogenol[tiab]
)


• Is exactly one line (no line breaks).  
• Uses uppercase AND/OR to combine concepts.  
• Wraps MeSH terms in quotes followed by [MeSH] (e.g., "Smoking"[MeSH]).  
• Marks synonym or free‐text terms with [tiab] (e.g., smoking[tiab]).  
• Groups synonyms with parentheses; groups PICO domains by combining with AND.  
• Does not include field tags other than [MeSH] and [tiab].  
• Does not include quotation marks around free‐text terms (other than MeSH).  
• Begins with a letter (A–Z or a–z) and contains no leading/trailing spaces.  
• Contains no line breaks or extra whitespace.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with each other. Just a reminder, every child's different. You know your baby best. Trust your instincts. And if it doesn't work for you, then we could try something else. Something.

Permeable electronics promise improved physiological comfort, but remain constrained by limited functional integration and poor mechanical robustness. Here, we report a three-dimensional (3D) permeable electronic system that overcomes these challenges by combining electrospun SEBS nanofiber mats, high-resolution liquid metal conductors patterned via thermal imprinting (50 μm), and a strain isolators (SIL) that protects vertical interconnects (VIAs) from stress concentration. This architecture achieves ultrahigh air permeability (> 5.09 mL cm-2 min-1), exceptional stretchability (750% fracture strain), and reliable conductivity maintained through more than 32,500 strain cycles. Leveraging these advances, we have integrated multilayer circuits, strain sensors, and a three-axis accelerometer to achieve a fully integrated, stretchable, permeable wireless real-time gesture recognition glove. The system enables accurate sign language interpretation (98%) and seamless robotic hand control, demonstrating its potential for assistive technologies. By uniting comfort, durability, and high-density integration, this work establishes a versatile platform for next-generation wearable electronics and interactive human-robot interfaces. © 2026.

Beyond the waiting room: exploring male participation in maternal health care in Nyasa District, Tanzania. Ndunguru FE(1), Mbunda KA(2). Author information: (1)Department of Gender Studies, The Mwalimu Nyerere Memorial Academy, Zanzibar, Tanzania. (2)Department of Gender Studies, The Mwalimu Nyerere Memorial Academy, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. This study examined male participation in maternal healthcare in Nyasa District, southern Tanzania. Although health policies emphasise men's involvement, it is often narrowly defined as physical presence at antenatal or delivery facilities. Using a qualitative case study with 45 semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions with men and women, the research explored how men actually engage in maternal care. Thematic analysis revealed that men's contributions extend well beyond clinic attendance to include financial and logistical support, birth preparedness, household assistance, emotional care, family planning participation, and monitoring maternal wellbeing. Women appreciated these forms of involvement but also reported persistent inequities, particularly in contraceptive decision-making, where male authority often prevailed. Limited clinic attendance was largely shaped by structural and livelihood constraints rather than disengagement, including subsistence farming, informal work, long travel distances, and gendered clinic environments. In the context of rural poverty and evolving gender norms, men's participation reflects both continuity and change in household gender relations. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive, context-sensitive understanding of male involvement that recognises relational care, addresses power imbalances, and informs inclusive, gender-equitable, and locally responsive maternal health policies and interventions.

BACKGROUND: Progress in mitigating plan degradation due to intrafraction patient motion may involve the identification and management of specific control points that are sensitive to motion. Robust planning in this manner could improve deliverable dosimetry and support advancements toward reducing planning target volume (PTV) margins. PURPOSE: To improve radiotherapy plan quality robustness in the presence of intrafraction motion by identifying the control-point-specific dosimetric sensitivities. This work explores control-point-specific plan characteristics that impact dosimetry by retrospectively assessing the consequence of simulated patient scenarios for cranial radiotherapy. METHODS: Single target cranial volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plans (n = 30) were converted into static field plans and reconstructed by applying 3D control-point-specific motion traces (n = 100) using our in-house MATLAB application. PTV coverage (volume covered by 100% of the prescription isodose, VRx) and the differences in minimum dose delivered to 99% (D99%) of the gross tumor volume (GTV) were examined across the patient cohort as these are pertinent metrics for each structure. To identify the individual control points where motion led to target coverage loss, three patient plans (5 and 14 were randomly chosen, and 19 with the greatest range in prescription dose coverage) were selected for an area under the curve (AUC) analysis of control point dose volume histograms (DVHs). The mean dose difference in the area under the curve of control point DVHs (mAUC), and the standard deviation of differences (sAUC) were the metrics used in the investigation. Multileaf collimator (MLC) aperture areas were also explored as a function of these metrics. RESULTS: Under conditions of simulated intrafraction motion, PTV coverage spanned from -2.8% to +0.73% of target volume with 78.6% of the three thousand motion traces resulting in coverage loss. There were no changes in GTV D99% that exceeded ± 1.5%. For the in-depth control point analysis, MLC aperture areas formed weak to moderately weak correlations with sAUC (r = -0.19, r = -0.42, and r = -0.32, p < 0.01 for patient plans 5, 14, and 19 respectively). In addition, two statistically distinct sub-populations of MLC aperture areas were confirmed by Welch corrected t-tests (p < 0.0001, p = 0.02, p = 0.005 for cases 5, 14 and 19) across a threshold of ± 0.05 mGy in mAUC. CONCLUSION: This work has demonstrated that the dosimetric impact of intrafractional motion reflects the inherent motion sensitivity of specific control points. Our findings suggest that motion sensitive control points could be selectively targeted for gating to enhance robustness against intrafraction motion and improve dosimetry in support of a PTV margin reduction strategy. Single target cranial plans serve as ideal cases to characterize the consequences of motion at the control point level with the aim of expanding the analysis to other anatomical regions. © 2026 The Author(s).

Author information: (1)Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA. (2)Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA. PURPOSE: We report our experience with the implementation of a same-day simulation and treatment C-arm linear accelerator (linac)-based stereotactic program for patients with intracranial and extracranial metastatic disease. METHODS: Between May 2021 and October 2023, patients were treated in our same-day program with linac-based SRS/SBRT. Two slots per week were offered. Patients with expedited clinical needs, able to undergo SRS/SBRT simulation and treatment, were considered. Extracranial treatments were required to meet standards for automated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) optimization. Intracranial treatments were limited to 1-3 lesions and 1-2 isocenters. The day before treatment, the patient needed to be identified, and any diagnostic imaging had to be available for the physician and dosimetrist to discuss the plan. On the day of treatment, simulation was scheduled for 8 AM and treatment at 4 PM by default, with the goal to complete treatment by 6 PM. We analyzed information about each patient's treatment plan and time spent on each step of the workflow. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients followed our same-day workflow and were included in the analysis. Seventy-five patients received intracranial SRS (57% to 1 lesion), while 22 patients received extracranial treatments (50% to the extremities). Simulation often required additional time to be completed, finishing a median 18 min (IQR 5-40) after the goal end time. The median time between simulation completion and end of the same-day treatment was 7.8 h (IQR 7.4-8.6). Treatment technique and the number of target volumes had a significant impact on planning time. The median treatment end time was 5:13 PM (IQR 4:46 PM-6:01 PM), with 74% ending by 6 PM. CONCLUSIONS: A linac-based program to treat patients with SRS/SBRT in an expedited fashion was established and successfully treated patients in a same-day timeline. Careful selection of planning techniques to limit plan complexity and adding automation in time-consuming parts of the process are crucial when developing expedited workflows. © 2026 The Author(s).

Hamilton H, Inder M(1). Author information: (1)University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand. INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition where many individuals experience difficulty getting well and staying well with ongoing symptoms and frequent relapses reflecting the limitation of current treatment approaches. Living with bipolar disorder touches every aspect of the individual's life and access to more effective treatments is necessary. The aim of this paper is to describe the impact of receiving a bipolar specific psychological intervention, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy. METHODS: This paper is a first-person narrative that reflects my experience of bipolar disorder including the different treatment approaches and their impact. FINDINGS: This Lived Experience Narrative reflects the significant limitations of medication focused and crisis short-term driven treatment which created an imbalanced approach limiting my ability to achieve significant periods of wellness. Having access to Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy fundamentally changed the approach to managing bipolar disorder. Over time this led to me having an increased sense of control, where bipolar disorder was something to work with rather than an external force controlling life and decisions, resulting in greater periods of wellness and stability. DISCUSSION: This narrative highlights the critical importance of having access to bipolar disorder specific interventions that go beyond medication and acute treatment approaches. Interpersonal and Social Rhythm therapy provides an understanding and approach that enables the individual with bipolar disorder to implement strategies and tools to more effectively manage their condition and to navigate a meaningful future. © 2025 The Author(s).

INTRODUCTION: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a common and concerning behavior in adolescents. However, most adolescents cease NSSI as they transition into adulthood. Increased knowledge of the cessation process is needed. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the factors contributing to NSSI cessation in individuals with lived experience of NSSI, providing valuable insights for treatment strategies. METHODS: Twenty-six individuals assigned female sex at birth, between ages 20-22 years, from Sweden were interviewed between 2021 and 2023 in Linköping, Sweden. Of these, 21 individuals perceived themselves as having ceased NSSI and were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis and Hooley and Franklins' Benefits and Barriers Model of NSSI were used to analyze the transcripts. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were generated: "Something inside me changed", "Something in my close relationships changed", and "Something in my life context changed". The cessation of NSSI was associated with several key factors. Improved well-being and envisioning a different future were pivotal in initiating the cessation process. Additionally, interpersonal relationships and support from others were interpreted as powerful motivators for change. Transitioning to a new social context and leaving behind a destructive environment provided opportunities for personal growth and enhanced well-being, interpreted as initiators in the participants' broader life context. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the complexity of the NSSI cessation process and highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors. Access to emotion regulation skills was perceived as a significant barrier to NSSI engagement. Clinical implications and different interventions to support NSSI cessation are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s).

BACKGROUND: Between 2015 and 2019 the Chronic Headache Education and Self-management Study (CHESS) developed and tested a supportive self-management approach that aimed to improve outcomes for people with chronic migraine or chronic tension type headache with/without episodic migraine. However, a paucity of qualitative research which explored the lived experiences of people with chronic headache was evidenced. In response, we undertook to explore the experiences of living with chronic headaches of people who participated in the CHESS study. METHODS: We adopted qualitative methodologies, inviting participants in the CHESS study to participate in semi-structured interviews. In phase 1 (feasibility study), a thematic analysis was conducted. In phase 2 (main CHESS trial), interviews were informed by topic guides developed from our learning from the phase 1 interviews. Pen portrait methodology and thematic analysis was employed allowing us to explore the data longitudinally. RESULTS: Phase 1, 15 interviews (10 female) age range 29 to 69 years (median 47 years) revealed the complexities of living with chronic headache. Six overarching themes were identified including the emotional impact and the nature of their headaches. Phase 2, included 66 interviews (26 participants; median age group 50s (range 20s-60s); 20 females. 14 were interviewed at three points in time (baseline, 4 and 12 months) Through an iterative process four overlapping categories of headache impact emerged from the data and were agreed: i) 'I will not let headaches rule my life'; ii) 'Headaches rule my life'; iii) 'Headaches out of control-something needs to change'; and iv) 'Headaches controlled-not ruling my life'. One of these categories was assigned to each pen portrait at each timepoint. The remaining 12 participants were interviewed at two time points during a year; pen portraits were again produced. Analysis revealed that the headache impact categories developed above held true in this sample also providing some validation of the categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data give an insight into the complexities of living with chronic headache. Chronic headache is unpredictable, permeating all aspects of an individual's life; even when an individual feels that their headache is controlled and not interfering, this situation can rapidly change. It shows us that more work needs to be done both medically and societally to help people living with this often-hidden condition. © 2024. The Author(s).

Author information: (1)University of Porto Institute of Biomedical Sciences Abel Salazar, Aveiro, Portugal. (2)University of Aveiro, Portugal. (3)University of the Balearic Islands, Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain. The process of transitioning involves making changes to align one's life with their authentic gender identity. This study explores the life trajectories of three Portuguese transgender women who transitioned later in life (50+ years old) by identifying key chapters in their life courses. Through inductive thematic analysis, six chapters were identified from the participants' interviews: (1) awareness of "something different in me," (2) locked into suffering, (3) finding comfort in something that is socially recognized, (4) "it is enough": it is time to recognize and embrace the woman I am, (5) living my life as a woman, and (6) building and leaving a legacy. Aging and the process of self-discovery played pivotal roles in participants' process of transitioning. The perception of finitude and the limitations associated with the time of life led them to realize that there was no time to waste and a sense of urgency to live authentically.

Este estudo explora as trajetórias de vida de três mulheres transgénero portuguesas que fizeram a transição mais tardia (depois dos 50 anos), identificando capítulos-chave nos seus percursos de vida. Através da análise temática indutiva, foram identificados seis capítulos a partir das entrevistas dos participantes: (1) consciência de “algo diferente em mim,” (2) fechada no sofrimento, (3) encontrar conforto em algo que é socialmente reconhecido, (4) “já chega:” é altura de reconhecer a mulher que sou, (5) viver a minha vida como mulher, e (6) construir e deixar um legado. O envelhecimento e o processo de autodescoberta desempenharam papéis fundamentais no processo de transição das participantes. A perceção da finitude e das limitações associadas ao tempo de vida levou-as a perceber que não havia tempo a perder, dando um sentido de urgência para viver de forma autêntica. © The Author(s) 2024.

(#)Contributed equally Materials design is an important component of modern science and technology, yet traditional approaches rely heavily on trial and error and can be inefficient. Computational techniques, enhanced by modern artificial intelligence, have reshaped the landscape of designing new materials. Among these approaches, inverse design has shown great promise in designing materials that meet specific property requirements. In this Review, we present key computational advances in materials design over the past few decades. We follow the evolution of relevant materials design techniques, from high-throughput forward machine learning methods and evolutionary algorithms, to advanced artificial intelligence strategies such as reinforcement learning and deep generative models. We highlight the paradigm shift from conventional screening approaches to inverse generation driven by deep generative models. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future perspectives of materials inverse design. This Review may serve as a brief guide to the approaches, progress and outlook of designing future functional materials with technological relevance. © 2026. Springer Nature Limited.

(6)Transfusion Antibody Exchange Inc, Woodbridge, Connecticut, USA. BACKGROUND: A national transfusion history sharing service, such as the alloantibody exchange, should provide standardized data. However, red cell antigen profiles frequently exist as unstructured text. To reduce human curation and improve scalability, we evaluated whether large language models (LLMs) could standardize free-text antigen profiles. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an academic center's antigen profiles, we compared open-weight LLMs run locally and commercial LLM accessed via the internet. Outputs were constrained to a prespecified format ("schema-guided decoding") and retries were allowed ("error-aware retries"). The primary outcome was an exact match of the antigen profile; secondary outcomes included antigen-level agreement, categorized error types, and processing cost. Differences were tested with Cochran's Q and pairwise McNemar tests with Holm correction. RESULTS: Of 908 deidentified red cell antigen profiles, a total of 10,547 antigens with 88 distinct antigens were noted. Performance differed significantly across LLMs (Cochran's Q = 3014.6, df = 10, p < 0.001). Commercial LLMs outperformed open source LLMs. Open-source models with a higher number of parameters outperformed smaller models. The top LLM matched 92.5% of the antigen profiles; antigen-level agreement reached 99.4%. Estimated API costs for commercial LLM were modest for the studied workload. DISCUSSION: Commercial LLMs can standardize unstructured antigen profiles with high accuracy when paired with schema-guided decoding and error-aware retries. The high accuracy shown by the LLMs suggests they would offer significant scalability while reducing manual curation for a national transfusion history sharing service like the alloantibody exchange. They represent a foundational technology for enabling such a service. DOI: 10.1111/trf.70061

Whether LLMs can generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that are of similar quality to those created by humans is unclear. This investigation assessed the quality of MCQs generated by LLMs compared to humans. METHODS: This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42025608775). A systematic review and frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) or pairwise meta-analysis was performed. Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Scopus were searched from inception to November 1, 2024. The quality of MCQs was assessed with seven pre-defined outcomes: question relevance, clarity, accuracy/correctness; distractor quality; item difficulty analysis; and item discrimination analysis (point biserial correlation and item discrimination index). Continuous data were transformed to a 10-point scale to facilitate statistical analysis and reported as mean differences (MD). The MERSQI and the Grade of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) NMA guidelines were used to assess risk of bias and certainty of evidence assessments. RESULTS: Five LLMs were included. NMA demonstrated that ChatGPT 4 generated similar quality MCQs to humans with regards to question relevance (MD -0.13; 95% CI: -0.44,0.18; GRADE: VERY LOW), question clarity (MD -0.03; 95% CI: -0.15,0.10; GRADE: VERY LOW), and distractor quality (MD -0.10; 95% CI: -0.24,0.04; GRADE: VERY LOW); however, MCQs generated by Llama 2 performed worse than humans with regards to question clarity (MD -1.21; 95% CI: -1.60,-0.82; GRADE: VERY LOW) and distractor quality (MD -1.50; 95% CI: -2.03,-0.97; GRADE: VERY LOW). Exploratory post-hoc t-tests demonstrated that ChatGPT 3.5 performed worse than Llama 2 and ChatGPT 4 with regards to question clarity and distractor quality (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: ChatGPT 4 may create similar quality MCQs to humans, whereas ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama 2 may be of worse quality. Further studies that directly compare these LLMs to human-generated questions and administer MCQs to students are required. Copyright: © 2026 Riehm et al.

Conceptualization of Risk Stratification Using Large Language Models to Predict Severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae Pneumonia. Adeyemi A(1), Nath S(2). Author information: (1)College of Medicine, Anne Burnett Marion School of Medicine, Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, USA. (2)Medical Education and Clinical Microbiology, Anne Burnett Marion School of Medicine, Texas Christian University, Fort Worth, USA. Background Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT-4o3 and GPT-5 (Deep Research, Deep Thinking), have emerged as tools with reasonable efficacy in multiple domains of healthcare to enhance literature synthesis, support reasoning, and guide diagnostic and management framework development. In clinical domains, LLMs have been evaluated for readability, accuracy, and decision support, but their role in health professions education scholarship is still emerging. Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is a self-limiting atypical pneumonia; however, a subset of cases progress to severe or necrotizing disease, even in otherwise healthy patients. Predicting such trajectories in immunocompetent adults remains difficult due to the variable nature of host susceptibility and immune factors. This study examines predictive features of severe MPP and explores how LLMs can be leveraged to construct a conceptual risk stratification framework for use in health professions, education scholarship, and research skills development. Methodology We analyzed a single case of necrotizing MPP in a 32-year-old woman to develop a conceptual risk-stratification framework. A structured literature review (2010-2024) was conducted to identify clinical, laboratory, and imaging predictors of severe or refractory MPP. These predictors were compared with the patient's course and organized into a three-tier framework (low, moderate, high risk) using supervised LLM-assisted synthesis. Results The case demonstrated several high-risk predictors of severe MPP, including cavitary disease, a loculated exudative effusion, and pneumothorax. Mapping these findings against literature-derived predictors placed the patient in the high-risk tier of a three-level framework, illustrating how LLM-assisted synthesis can convert a single case into a structured, hypothesis-generating, conceptual risk stratification framework. Conclusions This framework illustrates how LLM-assisted synthesis can link complex case data with published predictors to support early recognition of severe MPP. It also highlights a replicable educational approach for transforming single-patient narratives into hypothesis-generating tools that foster AI literacy and research skills in health professions education. To ensure appropriate interpretive boundaries, we emphasize that the conclusions are theoretical and hypothesis-generating rather than empirically validated. Because alternative interpretations of the literature-derived predictors are possible and the model is grounded in a single case, the framework should not be construed as a generalizable risk tool. Instead, it represents an educational scaffold demonstrating how structured synthesis can support reasoning while acknowledging the need for future empirical evaluation across larger patient samples.

Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies are facing growing pressure to strike a balance between production efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study investigated sophorolipid (SL) biosurfactants produced by Candida bombicola as environmentally compatible alternatives to synthetic surfactants in carbonated water flooding applications. Comprehensive characterization using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR spectroscopy confirmed a glycolipid structure with hydrophilic sophorose disaccharide heads and hydrophobic fatty acid tails. The biosurfactant demonstrated exceptional surface activity with a critical micelle concentration of 250 ppm, reducing the surface tension from 72 to 31 mN/m and achieving an ultralow interfacial tension of 2.2 mN/m, representing an 85% reduction from baseline conditions. The wettability modification experiments showed a systematic transition from oil-wet (106°) to water-wet (48°) conditions, facilitating enhanced oil mobilization. Synergistic effects were observed when 250 ppm of sophrolipid was combined with 1500 ppm of polyacrylamide (PAM), producing optimal shear-thinning rheology and a remarkable CO2 absorption capacity (2.82 mol/kg), 77% higher than that of water alone. High-pressure interfacial tension measurements confirmed the stability under CO2-enriched conditions (2.18 mN/m). These results establish SL-based biosurfactants as viable game changers for next-generation sustainable EOR operations, offering superior biodegradability, reduced toxicity, and the dual benefits of enhanced oil recovery with a CO2 sequestration potential. © 2025 The Authors.

The incidence of right-sided IE (RSIE) is increasing with injection drug use, indwelling lines, and device implantation. Although contemporary guidelines emphasize early referral to Heart Valve Centres and multidisciplinary Endocarditis Teams, many patients meeting surgical criteria are ineligible because of prohibitive risk, clinical instability, or social complexity. Percutaneous mechanical aspiration (PMA) with the AngioVac system has emerged as a minimally invasive option to debulk infected masses, expedite bacteremia clearance, and mitigate septic embolization, particularly for large tricuspid vegetations and device-related infection; highly selected left-sided infective endocarditis (LSIE) cases have also been reported. AngioVac couples a large-bore aspiration cannula to a veno-venous extracorporeal circuit with continuous transoesophageal echocardiography; neuroprotection is routine for left-sided targets. Across heterogeneous RSIE populations, technical success approximates 85-90%. Comparative analyses versus tricuspid surgery show broadly similar early and one-year mortality, with shorter length of stay after PMA. Cost and length-of-stay signals also favour PMA in cohort studies. Adjunctive use during transvenous lead extraction facilitates the removal of bulky vegetations and may improve survival. For left-sided experience with cerebral protection, complications include embolization, bleeding/transfusion, vascular or intracardiac injury, and persistent/worsened tricuspid regurgitation; conversion to surgery is uncommon. PMA with AngioVac may serve as a bridge to definitive therapy and expands options for otherwise inoperable patients. Evidence remains retrospective and short-term. Pragmatic, multicentre trials with core-lab echocardiography, standardized success definitions, and patient-centered endpoints are needed to refine indications and inform guideline integration.

Drommi M(1), Malikidogo KP(1), Atrián-Blasco E(1), Esmieu C(1), Hureau C(1). Author information: (1)Laboratoire De Chimie de Coordination, CNRS, Toulouse, France. ROS production due to Cu(amyloid-β) redox cycling is proposed to contribute to the oxidative stress observed in Alzheimer's disease brains. We previously reported on a nitrogen and sulfur-containing ligand, L, able to arrest Cu(Aβ)-induced ROS production [Chem. Eur. J. 2023, 29,]. In the present study, the intricate mechanism by which L maintains its protective activity in the presence of Zn, an abundant endogenous metal ion found in the synaptic cleft, is disentangled with the use of complementary spectroscopic and analytical investigations. This mechanism, which we refer to as kinetic Cu(I) shunt, relies on a faster Cu(I) than Zn transfer from Cu,Zn(Aβ) to L, followed by a fast re-oxidation of Cu(I)(L) to Cu(II)(L), which is redox-inert (i.e. resistant against reduction from ascorbate). This study hence provides new insights into the kinetic involvement of Cu(I) ions in the inhibition of Cu(Aβ)-associated ROS production in presence of Zn. © 2025 The Author(s).

(3)Department of Radiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, INTRODUCTION: Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Traditional imaging techniques including CT and MRI provide valuable anatomical data but often overlook the liver's functional heterogeneity, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review explores advancements in functional imaging modalities, including contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and PET/CT, which provide detailed insights into tumor biology and treatment response in HCC. CEUS enables real-time assessment of hepatic microvascular perfusion with excellent temporal resolution and without ionizing radiation. DCE-MRI and perfusion CT permit time-resolved quantification of perfusion kinetics and vascular permeability, offering surrogate biomarkers of tumor angiogenesis and treatment response. PET/CT, through tracers captures regional variations in metabolism, reflecting tumor viability and functional reserve. EXPERT OPINION: Collectively, these modalities advance precision imaging by linking physiological and metabolic information to morphologic findings, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and therapy monitoring in hepatocellular carcinoma.

"A massive burden off my shoulders": participant experiences of a novel cyberscam psychosocial recovery intervention for people with acquired brain injury. Chew KA(1)(2), Ponsford JL(1)(2), Gould KR(1)(2). Author information: (1)Monash-Epworth Rehabilitation Research Centre, Melbourne, Australia. (2)School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. PURPOSE: Cyberscam survivors experience significant financial losses and devastating psychosocial consequences. Anyone can be scammed, but people with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) may be particularly vulnerable. Smooth Sailing After Scams is a novel co-designed 10-session cyberscam psychosocial intervention piloted with people with ABI who had been scammed. This study aimed to qualitatively explore participants' experiences of the program. METHOD: Twenty-two adults (nABI=10, nclose others=8, nclinicians=3) who participated in, or delivered the intervention completed one semi-structured interview via videoconferencing (Mage=54.7, SD = 17.5). Reflexive thematic analysis was used. RESULTS: Seven themes were generated, reflecting factors that supported intervention outcomes and participant experiences. "Intervention enablers" incorporated: 1) "Sense of community"; 2) "Therapeutic alliance"; and 3) "Well-run and well-managed", "Therapeutic enhancers": 4) "Increasing insight through the scam adjustment journey"; 5) "It's brought us closer", "Positive outcomes": 6) "I learnt how to stay safe online", 7) "I don't feel shame". CONCLUSIONS: This novel cyberscam psychosocial adjustment intervention was perceived to support improvements in cybersafety, emotional and social wellbeing. Further refinement and empirical evaluation through a controlled trial are needed. This work contributes to the often-overlooked area of aftercare for the psychosocial impacts of scams, with particular attention to some of the most vulnerable in the community. Plain Language Summary: Qualitatively, the Smooth Sailing After Scams program resulted in positive outcomes in terms of cybersafety, emotional wellbeing and social support for people with acquired brain injury (ABI).Positive outcomes were a result of the group format, ABI-specific cohorts, strong therapeutic alliance and individualisation.The conceptualised post-scam adjustment as a journey was beneficial in providing insight to cyberscam experiences, acting as both an enabler and outcome of the program.Findings support further research through controlled trials investigating efficacy on a broader scale.

The lived experiences and coping mechanisms of women with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative evidence. Abebe Y(1), Bekele D(2), Demissie R(2)(3). Author information: (1)Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Science, Dilla University, Dilla, Ethiopia. (2)Institute of Health, School of Nursing, Wollega University, Nekemte, Ethiopia. (3)Ingraham School of Nursing, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada. BACKGROUND: Obstetric fistula, a preventable consequence of prolonged obstructed labor, inflicts profound physical, psychological, and social suffering, leaving many women described as "living dead." In Ethiopia, where the burden remains high, little is known about women lived experiences and coping strategies beyond clinical outcomes. This review was conducted to synthesize qualitative evidence, illuminate these challenges, and inform holistic interventions. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize available evidence on the lived experiences and coping mechanisms of women with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia. DESIGN: This study employed a qualitative meta-synthesis approach. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: This review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute systematic review and meta-synthesis methodological guidance and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. ATLAS.ti software, Version 25, Lumivero was used for analysis. A comprehensive literature search was performed across multiple databases up to May 25, 2025, including both published and unpublished studies examining the lived experiences of women with obstetric fistula. All eligible studies were critically appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program to ensure methodological rigor. Data were systematically extracted and analyzed using thematic synthesis, and the results are presented through tables, narrative summaries, and illustrative diagrams, providing a coherent and evidence-based synthesis of women's experiences and coping mechanisms. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, encompassing the diverse experiences of women with obstetric fistula in Ethiopia. Four major themes were developed: physical challenges such as pain, foot drop, odor, and urinary incontinence; psychological challenges including hopelessness, grief, and suicidal ideation; socioeconomic challenges like stigma, isolation, divorce, loneliness, social disintegration, and economic difficulties; and coping mechanisms such as self-isolation and wearing multiple layers of clothing. CONCLUSION: Women with obstetric fistula face intersecting physical, psychological, and socioeconomic burdens that erode dignity and social participation. Coping strategies such as self-isolation and layering clothes, while adaptive, often reinforce stigma and exclusion. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive interventions that go beyond surgical repair to include psychosocial support, stigma reduction, and economic reintegration programs. REGISTRATION: Registered with PROSPERO 2025 CRD420251064015. Plain Language Summary: Lived experience and coping mechanism of women with obstetric fistulaIn Ethiopia, thousands of women live with a hidden injury -an obstetric fistula - that silently devastates their bodies, mind, and social lives. Caused by prolonged, obstructed labor without timely medical care, this condition leads to uncontrollable leakage of urine or feces. But the suffering doesn’t stop there. These women are often abandoned by their families, divorced by their husbands, and excluded from their communities. Many describe themselves as “living dead,” trapped in shame, isolation, and despair. Some wear layers of clothing to hide the wetness and odor. Others retreat from society altogether, avoiding markets, churches, and even their own relatives. This study brings together voices from across Ethiopia eight qualitative studies that reveal the raw, unfiltered experiences of women with obstetric fistula. The findings are clear: Physically, they endure pain, sores, foot drop, and constant wetness. Psychologically, they face hopelessness, grief, and suicidal thoughts. Socially, they suffer stigma, loneliness, and economic hardship. To cope, they isolate themselves and use improvised methods to manage their condition. But these strategies, while understandable, often deepen the problem delaying care and reinforcing exclusion. This review calls for urgent change. Healing must go beyond surgery. Women need mental health support, economic empowerment, and community reintegration. Obstetric fistula is not just a medical issue it’s a matter of dignity, justice, and equity.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by persistent itching, dryness, redness, and recurrent eczematous lesions, significantly impacting patients' quality of life and psychological well-being. Despite various effective conventional treatments, innovative therapeutic approaches that simultaneously provide anti-inflammatory effects and enhanced skin hydration remain essential. OBJECTIVE: This case-series study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy, patient satisfaction, and safety profile of polynucleotide (PN)-based injectable therapies in patients with AD. METHODS: Patients with clinically diagnosed AD underwent intradermal injections of PN. Treatment outcomes were assessed by comparing standardized clinical photographs taken before and after the PN treatment, focusing on improvements in erythema, skin thickness, and overall skin hydration. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes, including reductions in itching, discomfort, and treatment satisfaction, were evaluated. RESULTS: Posttreatment evaluations demonstrated notable clinical improvements, including reduced erythema, decreased skin thickness, and enhanced skin hydration and elasticity. Patients consistently reported significant alleviation of itching and overall discomfort. Furthermore, high patient satisfaction and good adherence to treatment were observed, with no significant adverse events or side effects reported. CONCLUSION: This exploratory case series provides preliminary observations suggesting that PN-based injectable therapies may offer benefits for patients with AD, particularly in improving skin hydration, barrier function, and symptomatic relief. While positive outcomes were documented in all four cases, the absence of validated scoring systems, objective biophysical measures, long-term follow-up, and a control group limits the strength and generalizability of these findings. PN injections in this context remain off-label, and further prospective, controlled studies with larger, more diverse populations are essential to establish efficacy, safety, optimal dosing regimens, and durability of response. © 2026 The Author(s).

In some of the wildest speculations, the humans involved in conducting scientific studies and experiments and vetting the results for publication will be steadily eliminated from the process.

Considerable evidence supports the importance of sleep for memory consolidation, learning, academic performance, and mental health. College students in health-related fields are often deprived of adequate sleep due to the high volume of clinical assignments and academic workload. Studies on the relationship between sleep quality, chronotypes and academic performance in Brazilian university students are scarce. Therefore, we investigated how study and sleep habits, chronotype and sleep quality influence college performance. We conducted a questionnaire-based study with 573 health-related fields students from several Brazilian institutions. The participants filled out an individual form with personal data, answered the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The sleep-wake cycle pattern and sleep behavioural habits in the day before a test/assessment were obtained with 4 answer options of the question "On the day before the assessment in question, what was your behaviour? "I stay up late studying and don't sleep (Deprived), I stay up late studying and sleep before the test (Study-Sleep), I sleep early and wake up early and study until the exam is close (Sleep-Study), I don't change my sleep routine (No Deprived). The comparison of academic performance between the groups showed that those students who did not change their routine performed better compared to the others. Our results reveal that most Brazilian undergraduate students in the health-related fields have poor sleep quality. Sleep quality scores and chronotype´s scores were significantly associated with academic performance only in the female population. It is essential in the academic space to take care of the sleep/wake cycle and consequently the learning process, in order to develop interventions to promote the quality of sleep and quality of life for students in the health area.

BACKGROUND: Understanding illness representations is considered important for improving health outcomes, yet how people with functional seizures reflect on the possible psychological function of their seizures has not been studied. METHODS: A semi-structured interview comprising open and closed questions was administered to 99 participants with a documented diagnosis of functional seizures. One item, 'What do you think your functional seizure symptoms are telling you?" sought to explore how individuals reflect on the possible function of their seizures. Qualitative analysis using NVivo comprised thematic content analysis of responses to the question, and pattern analysis, to determine association with diagnosis acceptance, and openness to a possible psychological aetiology. RESULTS: Most patients (88 %) readily interpreted their seizures in response to this question. We identified one major theme, with the majority of participants interpreting seizure symptoms as an enforced hiatus. Two minor themes were identified: personal growth and contempt. Subthemes were identified within both the enforced hiatus (stop, slow down, relax) and personal growth (self-care, self-development, acceptance) themes. Individuals who did not accept the diagnosis of functional seizures referenced seizures with contempt towards the self or answered, 'don't know'. Respondents who did not know also tended to reject a psychological basis for their seizures in contrast to those who discussed themes of enforced hiatus, personal growth, and contempt. CONCLUSIONS: Responses provide valuable insight into how individuals reflect on their condition in a non-acute setting. Themes can serve as a foundation for future therapeutic discussions and patient-centred communication strategies to build a mutual understanding of the potential function of physical symptoms regardless of whether a psychological basis for them is accepted or not. What is already known on this topic: Outcomes for functional seizures are generally poor and often attributed to patients rejecting psychiatric care or not accepting the diagnosis. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study is the first to explore patient conceptualisations of the possible function of their functional seizures as a therapeutic tool for understanding the condition. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy: Findings may provide a basis for improved clinician-patient relationships, treatment engagement, and more targeted interventions for people with functional seizures.

An update on the inclusion of sex as a variable in AJP-Cell Physiology. Holland A(1), Bradbury NA(1). Author information: (1)Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, Illinois, United States. "I don't know the question, but sex is definitely the answer!," was a Woody Allen quote cited by Fuller and Insel in an Editorial Comment in 2013 on the importance of cell sex in submissions to AJP-Cell Physiology, and in biomedical research in general. The notion that cell sex is important is axiomatic in studies on prostate cancer (LnCAP) or placental physiology (BeWo). Indeed, most researchers are aware that HeLa cells are female cervical derived, and CHO are female hamster ovary cells, yet beyond those well-known examples, it would be fair to assume that the sex of cells derived from kidney, lung, or liver, for example, is given cursory, if any thought. In the end, what possible impact could the presence or absence of a Y chromosome have on protein trafficking in a nonreproductive tissue, such as a pancreatic β cell? However, this approach to cell, and indeed organismal physiology, seems to be in conflict with accumulating data, that show that far from being irrelevant, genes expressed off sex chromosomes have a broad-ranging impact on cells as diverse as neurons and renal cells. Moreover, it is also the policy of AJP-Cell Physiology that the source of all cells used (species, sex, etc.) should be clearly indicated when submitting an article for publication (https://journals.physiology.org/author-info.manuscript-composition). In 2013, we wrote a review examining how faithfully such requirements were adhered to in submissions to Cell Physiology. Nearly a decade later, it seems fitting to revisit the topic and ask if any improvements have been made in the description of cells and cell lines used in publications submitted to AJP-Cell Physiology.

Additionally, many studies have only investigated univariable associations instead of multivariable associations; to our knowledge, none have investigated the independent association of baseline sociodemographics, quality of life, improvement in pain and function, experiences with healthcare delivery, and baseline measures of mental health with satisfaction with treatment results. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What factors are independently associated with satisfaction with treatment results at 3 months post-treatment in patients treated for common hand and wrist conditions? (2) What factors are independently associated with the willingness to undergo the treatment again at 3 months post-treatment in patients treated for common hand and wrist conditions? Among the factors under study were baseline sociodemographics, quality of life, improvement in pain and function, experiences with healthcare delivery, and baseline measures of mental health. METHODS: Between August 2018 and May 2020, we included patients who underwent carpal tunnel release, nonsurgical or surgical treatment for thumb-base osteoarthritis, trigger finger release, limited fasciectomy for Dupuytren contracture, or nonsurgical treatment for midcarpal laxity in one of the 28 centers of Xpert Clinics in the Netherlands. We screened 5859 patients with complete sociodemographics and data at baseline. Thirty-eight percent (2248 of 5859) of these patients had complete data at 3 months. Finally, participants were eligible for inclusion if they provided a relevant answer to the three patient-reported experience measure (PREM) items. A total of 424 patients did not do this because they answered "I don't know" or "not applicable" to a PREM item, leaving 31% (1824 of 5859) for inclusion in the final sample. A validated Satisfaction with Treatment Result Questionnaire was administered at 3 months, which identified the patients' level of satisfaction with treatment results so far on a 5-point Likert scale (research question 1, with answers of poor, moderate, fair, good, or excellent) and the patients' willingness to undergo the treatment again under similar circumstances (research question 2, with answers of yes or no). A hierarchical logistic regression model was used to identify whether baseline sociodemographics, quality of life, change in outcome (patient-reported outcome measures for hand function and pain), baseline measures of mental health (including treatment credibility [the extent to which a patient attributes credibility to a treatment] and expectations, illness perception, pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression), and PREMs were associated with each question of the Satisfaction with Treatment Result Questionnaire at 3 months post-treatment. We dichotomized responses to our first question as good and excellent, which were considered more satisfied, and poor, moderate, and fair, which were considered less satisfied. After dichotomization, 57% (1042 of 1824) of patients were classified as more satisfied with the treatment results. RESULTS: The following variables were independently associated with satisfaction with treatment results, with an area under the curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.84) (arranged from the largest to the smallest standardized odds ratio [SOR]): greater decrease in pain during physical load (standardized odds ratio 2.52 [95% CI 2.18 to 2.92]; p < 0.001), patient's positive experience with the explanation of the pros and cons of the treatment (determined with the question: "Have you been explained the pros and cons of the treatment or surgery?") (SOR 1.83 [95% CI 1.41 to 2.38]; p < 0.001), greater improvement in hand function (SOR 1.76 [95% CI 1.54 to 2.01]; p < 0.001), patients' positive experience with the advice for at-home care (determined with the question: "Were you advised by the healthcare providers on how to deal with your illness or complaints in your home situation?") (SOR 1.57 [95% CI 1.21 to 2.04]; p < 0.001), patient's better personal control (determined with the question: "How much control do you feel you have over your illness?") (SOR 1.24 [95% CI 1.1 to 1.40]; p < 0.001), patient's more positive treatment expectations (SOR 1.23 [95% CI 1.04 to 1.46]; p = 0.02), longer expected illness duration by the patient (SOR 1.20 [95% CI 1.04 to 1.37]; p = 0.01), a smaller number of symptoms the patient saw as part of the illness (SOR 0.84 [95% CI 0.72 to 0.97]; p = 0.02), and less concern about the illness the patient experiences (SOR 0.84 [95% CI 0.72 to 0.99]; p = 0.04). For willingness to undergo the treatment again, the following variables were independently associated with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.83) (arranged from the largest to the smallest standardized OR): patient's positive experience with the information about the pros and cons (determined with the question: "Have you been explained the pros and cons of the treatment or surgery?") (SOR 2.05 [95% CI 1.50 to 2.80]; p < 0.001), greater improvement in hand function (SOR 1.80 [95% CI 1.54 to 2.11]; p < 0.001), greater decrease in pain during physical load (SOR 1.74 [95% CI 1.48 to 2.07]; p < 0.001), patient's positive experience with the advice for at home (determined with the question: "Were you advised by the healthcare providers on how to deal with your illness or complaints in your home situation?") (SOR 1.52 [95% CI 1.11 to 2.07]; p = 0.01), patient's positive experience with shared decision-making (determined with the question: "Did you decide together with the care providers which care or treatment you will receive?") (SOR 1.45 [95% CI 1.06 to 1.99]; p = 0.02), higher credibility the patient attributes to the treatment (SOR 1.44 [95% CI 1.20 to 1.73]; p < 0.001), longer symptom duration (SOR 1.27 [95% CI 1.09 to 1.52]; p < 0.01), and patient's better understanding of the condition (SOR 1.17 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.34]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that to directly improve satisfaction with treatment results, clinicians might seek to: (1) improve the patient's experience with healthcare delivery, (2) try to influence illness perception, and (3) boost treatment expectations and credibility. Future research should confirm whether these suggestions are valid and perhaps also investigate whether satisfaction with treatment results can be predicted (instead of explained, as was done in this study). Such prediction models, as well as other decision support tools that investigate patient-specific needs, may influence experience with healthcare delivery, expectations, or illness perceptions, which in turn may improve satisfaction with treatment results.

Archaeological and anthropological evidence suggests that human ancestors' diets were rich in fiber, potassium, and complex carbohydrates, while low in sodium, refined sugars, and energy density. Over time, agroindustrialization led to diets poorer in fiber and micronutrients but higher in sodium, simple sugars, and calorie-dense foods. This shift contributed to the rise of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, which now account for 70% of global premature deaths. Maternal nutrition affects fetal development and long-term health. High sucrose or fructose intake during pregnancy can alter placental function, impacting fetal growth and metabolism. Placentae from male and female fetuses may respond differently to maternal diet. However, the effects of excessive maternal fructose intake on the placenta and offspring remain underexplored. In this study, rat dams consuming fructose-sweetened beverages ate less food but drank more, significantly impacting placental volume and vascular structure. Long-term effects on offspring were sex-specific: females showed greater water retention and liver fat accumulation. High maternal fructose intake altered placental anatomy and had sex-specific effects on kidney and liver function in adult offspring, even without further fructose exposure. These findings highlight the importance of maternal diet in preventing future metabolic diseases. © 2025 The Author(s).

Double-layer carotenoid-rich emulsions as fat replacers: Application in salad dressings and low-fat chocolate cakes. Silva Santos J(1), Freitas Ribeiro MLF(1), Nicoletti VR(1). Author information: (1)Institute of Biosciences, Humanities and Exact Sciences (IBILCE), São Paulo State University (UNESP), São Paulo, Brazil. The growing consumption of salad dressings has driven the use of emulsion technology to develop foods with low oil content while maintaining high nutritional value. This study aimed to formulate emulsions using buriti (Mauritia flexuosa) and sunflower oils, stabilized by a double-layer system of soy protein and high-methoxyl pectin. These emulsions, rich in carotenoids and low in fat, were applied to low-fat salad dressings and as fat substitutes in chocolate cakes. Composition results showed carotenoid concentrations of up to 76.44 μg/g in salad dressings and 253.55 μg/g in vegetable creams. Both products exhibited pseudoplastic rheological behavior with weak gel viscoelastic properties. Variations in the buriti oil-to-sunflower oil ratio did not affect the rheological properties of the creams, but increasing total oil content increased their consistency index, whereas the creams with 50% oil displayed viscoelastic behavior. Cakes made with fat substitutes were firmer than those made with oil and had increased adhesiveness due to higher water content. Overall, the results demonstrated that it is possible to reduce calorie content and enhance vitamin levels without significantly altering the texture parameters of cakes or the rheological properties of dressings, meeting the market demand for low-fat products.

1. Mediterranean Diet. Daley SF(1), Hinson MR(2). In: StatPearls [Internet]. Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2025 Jan–. 2025 Nov 7. Author information: (1)Cape Cod Hospital, Hyannis, MA (2)Conemaugh Memorial The term Mediterranean diet refers to the traditional eating patterns of people living in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, including Greece, Italy, southern France, Crete, Spain, and parts of the Middle East. The diet is primarily a plant-based eating pattern that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, with olive oil as the primary source of fat. Rich in minimally processed plant foods and monounsaturated and unsaturated fats from olives, nuts, and seeds, but low in saturated fats, the diet is relatively high in total fat, with at least 35% of calories from fat. The Mediterranean Diet includes moderate amounts of fish, poultry, and fermented dairy products, while red and processed meats are consumed in minimal quantities. Moderate wine drinking with meals has traditionally been an optional part of the diet.  First recognized in the post–World War II era and later defined through the Seven Countries Study, the Mediterranean eating pattern has been linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease and increased lifespan, sparking decades of research into its health benefits. Post–World War II research, beginning with Leland Allbaugh's Rockefeller Foundation–funded survey of Crete, described a local diet rich in olives, olive oil, whole grains, pulses, fruits, vegetables, and herbs, with low consumption of animal products. The Seven Countries Study, launched in 1958 by American physiologist Ancel Keys, later compared dietary patterns and health outcomes across 7 countries and found that populations in Italy and Greece, which primarily consumed olive oil as their main fat, had lower rates of all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality than those in northern Europe and the United States, providing evidence for the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. Historically, the Mediterranean diet was deeply rooted in local agriculture, climate, and cultural traditions, with meals centered on seasonal, minimally processed plant foods and communal eating as a key part of daily life. This sociocultural and economic context is increasingly uncommon in the twenty-first century, as modernization and globalization have shifted toward processed foods, including those with added sugars, refined grains, and industrial or animal fats, accompanied by a decline in home cooking and the sharing of meals. The "contemporary" Mediterranean diet, often discussed in clinical research and popular publications, reflects an adaptation of the traditional lifestyle rather than a direct continuation. The diet emphasizes similar core food groups but is implemented within modern food systems, diverse cultures, and different socioeconomic settings, factors that can influence adherence, nutrient quality, and overall health effects. This activity examines key issues related to the Mediterranean diet, including evidence for health benefits, contemporary application of the diet, and the limitations of existing scientific research. Also reviewed are the consensus recommendations from leading professional organizations and highlights practical strategies for interprofessional teams to incorporate the diet into patient education and chronic disease management. The article aims to equip clinicians with the tools needed to counsel patients on adopting this dietary pattern in practice by addressing both the scientific basis and real-world applications.

Liver androgen receptor knockout attenuates high-fructose diet-induced glucose dysregulation in female mice. Oliver T(1), Osei-Ntansah A(1), Falzarano C(1), Rahman MA(1), Lofton T(1), Harvey G(1), Andrisse S(1). Author information: (1)Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Howard University, College of Medicine, Washington, District of Columbia, United States. The Western diet, rich in fats and sugars such as fructose, contributes significantly to the global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although both high-fat diets (HFD) and high-fructose diets (HFrD) are known to impair hepatic insulin signaling, the specific mechanisms and potential sex-specific differences remain underexplored. Moreover, the role of hepatic androgen receptor (AR) in modulating these effects, particularly in females, has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the contribution of hepatic AR to HFrD-induced metabolic dysfunction using liver-specific AR knockout (LivARKO) mice of both sexes. Male and female LivARKO and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to either a HFrD or calorie-matched control diet from 4 to 12 wk of age and underwent several metabolic tests during months 1 and 2. Glucose tolerance tests (GTT) conducted during month 1 revealed that WT-HFrD females developed significant glucose intolerance, whereas LivARKO-HFrD females exhibited partial protection, demonstrating improved glucose clearance relative to their WT counterparts. These effects appeared sex-specific, as male LivARKO mice did not exhibit similar protective effects under HFrD conditions. Our findings suggest that hepatic AR plays a sex-specific role in mediating fructose-induced insulin resistance, and its deletion in females confers partial protection against diet-induced metabolic impairments by improving hepatic insulin signaling and regulating gluconeogenic genes. This highlights the importance of considering sex and hepatic androgen signaling in the development of targeted therapies for diet-induced metabolic disorders.NEW & NOTEWORTHY To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that liver-specific androgen receptor (AR) deletion in female mice provides selective protection against fructose-induced insulin resistance. Although hepatic AR loss improves insulin sensitivity, it does not fully preserve insulin secretion or gluconeogenic control, revealing a sex-specific, dichotomous role of hepatic AR in metabolic regulation. These findings highlight hepatic AR as a potential therapeutic target for diet- and androgen-related metabolic dysfunction in females.

DNA polymerase theta (POLθ) has been regarded as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of BRCA-deficient tumors. In this study, 1-(arylacetyl)-2-phenyl-pyrrolidine derivative VS-13 was identified as a POLθ-pol inhibitor hit with an IC50 value of 1.47 μM through virtual screening. The followed similarity research obtained a more potent analogue SS-5, which was hybridized with RP-6685 to get 1-(phenylacetyl)-2-phenyl-pyrrolidine derivative F-1. It showed potent POLθ inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 170 nM, and good anti-proliferative activity against BRCA2-deficient DLD1 and HCT116 cell lines, with IC50 values of 4.39 μM and 4.79 μM, respectively. Further MD simulations and interaction analysis disclosed the possible binding mode of F-1 with POLθ-pol. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC. DOI: 10.1002/ddr.70216 PMID: 41459625 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

(2)Predisurge, Grande Usine Creative 2, Saint-Etienne, France. Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly valuable for cardiovascular prediction and simulation, offering critical support for medical decision-making. These models are particularly useful for predicting disease progression and evaluating potential treatments. A major challenge in these models is to preserve the geometric fidelity of meshes while optimizing parameter efficiency to reduce memory usage, computational resources and execution time. In this paper, we present innovative approaches to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) mesh compression, utilizing both statistical and deep learning models, with a focus on unsupervised learning techniques. We explore principal component analysis (PCA) as a statistical method and compare it with several deep learning models, including a simple autoencoder, an enhanced autoencoder based on PCA, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and a graph neural network (GNN). Human aortas are compressed using different statistical and deep learning methods to get the most relevant features. The mesh is reconstructed using the computed features and the error of the reconstructed meshes is compared. Our results indicate that PCA, using 64 principal components, outperforms deep learning models with a comparable latent space of 64, achieving the best overall performance. Among the deep learning approaches, the PCA-based autoencoder demonstrates the highest effectiveness. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/cnm.70124 PMID: 41360499 [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Author information: (1)Independent psychologist, Calvos, Portugal / Rillaar, Belgium. Farina and Schimmenti detail and define the potential consequences for their health when children meet and cannot escape from primary caretakers who neglect, maltreat, and abuse them. They define attachment trauma in this frame and thereby overcome some of the limitations of previous formulations. Inspired by their important work, I try to make a few points. Being ecosystems, we must long and strive to get the useful, to avoid and get rid of the harmful, and to leave alone what is useless. Part of the complexity of our being and becoming is that we include multiple longings and strivings, and that these can be contradictory. Per our very nature, and particularly as children, we long and strive to attach to our primary caretakers, defend against threat, and gain power to act. What to feel, think, and do when caretakers we depend on and must learn from are in fact harmful or useless to us, and the rest of our environment does not care or intervene? What is useful, harmful, and meaningless? Attachment trauma, then, is an ecological injury that evolves when harmful powers of caretakers and others far exceed our own power to act. Being ecosystems, the form the injury takes depends on this reciprocal causing. While it is an injury, it also is a creative effort to live and make sense of a mostd difficult life. © 2025 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.

(12)Department of Environment and Geography, University of York, York, England, BACKGROUND: Child and adolescent mental health is a public health priority, and prevention, early intervention, and treatment are identified as national strategic priorities. Children and young people (CYP) in the United Kingdom are experiencing poorer mental health outcomes than ever, and the demand for services is the highest on record. Understanding the effectiveness of school-based interventions for promoting and developing emotional well-being is a core research priority. A school-based intervention that is inclusive and has the potential for widespread delivery is 'Forest School'. Forest schools provide children with immersive experiences in nature that are non-classroom-based and have a core focus on child-led activities and exploration. Despite widespread implementation, evidence about optimal delivery methods for Forest Schools and their impact on mental health and emotional well-being is scarce. This study will generate new knowledge about the feasibility of running a definitive Forest School trial with Key Stage 2 (KS2) children aged between 7-11 inclusive of children with special educational needs and disabilities. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Is Forest School an acceptable and feasible intervention to improve the mental health of KS2 children?Is it feasible to run a cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of Forest School for children in key stage 2 (aged 7-11)? OBJECTIVES: 1. Test feasibility of trial procedures for recruitment, randomisation, and data collection2. Conduct a mixed methods process evaluation to evaluate implementation and fidelity3. Collect feasibility data to support an economic evaluation in a full trial4. Refine the current logic model and optimise the intervention. METHODS: In Work Package (WP) 1, we will conduct a feasibility cluster RCT of a Forest School intervention with 200 children in five schools across Hull, East Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire. We will test the acceptability and feasibility of intervention delivery, assess the feasibility of the trial processes, and establish key parameters for effectiveness. In WP2, we will evaluate the quality and fidelity of intervention delivery through process evaluation, including observations and qualitative interviews. WP3 focused on the preliminary collection of health economic data. WP4 uses focus groups to refine the logic model and optimize the content of the intervention. We seek to produce a manualised toolkit informed by interconnected work packages to inform further research and implementation. The trial was registered in ISRCTN (The United Kingdom's Trial Registry). Clinical Trials Registration Number ISRCTN87263624. PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: This proposal was developed with the active involvement of parents/guardians, children, and schools alongside key stakeholders from the local authority, education, and the community sector. DISSEMINATION: We will develop accessible presentations, online workshops with interactive elements, and newsletters. Producing a set of easily read infographics and creative outputs (video/social media) alongside our children's Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) groups will be a key output. We anticipate that two publications in open-access peer-reviewed journals will share the quantitative and qualitative findings of the study. Plain Language Summary: More children and young people than ever are experiencing problems with their mental health. It can be hard for them to get the help they need because waiting times for mental health services are often long. Schools are an important place where children can get support for their wellbeing. One approach that may help is spending more time outdoors and connecting with nature, which has been shown to benefit mental health. Forest School is a type of outdoor learning that involves play, exploration, and hands-on activities in nature. These sessions are becoming more common in schools and community settings. Some people believe Forest School can improve children’s mental health, but we don’t yet have strong evidence to show this. WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT? We want to find out if it’s possible to run a larger study in the future to test whether Forest School can help children's mental health. To do this, we’re running a smaller study first, called a “feasibility trial”. This helps us understand what works and what doesn’t before moving on to a bigger project. WHAT WILL WE DO? We will work with primary schools in England that can run Forest School sessions. The schools will be asked to offer similar types of activities.We will include year groups from Key Stage 2. Some children will be randomly chosen to take part in Forest School for 12 weeks. The other children will continue with their usual school activities during that time. After two terms, the second group will also get the chance to take part in Forest School.We will check:If schools can run the programme as planned.If we can collect the right information about children’s mental health and wellbeing.Whether families and school staff are happy with how the study is run.How much it costs to deliver Forest School.We will also interview children, parents, and staff to understand their experiences. INVOLVING CHILDREN PARENTS AND PROFESSIONALS: Our research team includes people with lived experience. One is a parent of children with additional needs, and another is a Forest School teacher who works with children with special educational needs. We’ve also worked closely with young people from a group called Re-Wilding Youth Hull to help design the study in a way that makes sense to them. SHARING WHAT WE FIND: We will create easy-to-understand summaries of our findings and share them with parents, schools, and mental health professionals. We will also publish the results in academic journals and speak about them at health and education conferences.Throughout the study, we’ll use blogs and social media (like Instagram and Twitter) to keep people updated on our progress.

Melchior R(1), Funke R(2), Wilken B(2), Jenke A(1). Author information: (1)From the General Pediatrics and Neonatology, Childrens Hospital, Klinikum Kassel, Kassel, Germany. (2)Department of Pediatric Neurology, Childrens Hospital, Klinikum Kassel, Kassel, Germany. We report a 2.5-year-old boy who was presented with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Emergency endoscopy showed two active mucosal bleeding sites that were successfully clipped. Initially, multiple intestinal angiodysplasias were considered, ruled out by a second control endoscopy. Here, multiple superficial lesions were observed that bled upon contact by the endoscope, suggestive of connective tissue disorder. However, the patient showed no clinical dysmorphias, only hypermobility of the toes but no other symptoms typical for such disorders. Gene testing for Ehlers-Danlos-syndrome (EDS) revealed a pathogenic mutation in the COL3A1 causing loss-of-function of type 3-collagen. Thus, diagnosis of EDS type IV was established. Overall, EDS is a rare cause for intestinal bleeding in children, even in children with no other clinical symptoms. This case is the earliest presentation of EDS type IV with intestinal complications. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Author information: (1)University of Connecticut, School of Nursing, Storrs. Postpartum preeclampsia has not received the needed attention that preeclampsia has. It is the lesser-known hypertensive disorder but can be just as life-threatening as eclampsia. Because of the scarcity of qualitative research on postpartum preeclampsia, the purpose of this study was to help fill this gap by exploring personal experiences of this dangerous complication as described in online blogs. Using Google search engine, 25 stories of postpartum preeclampsia were located. Krippendorff's content analysis for qualitative data was the research design used. Five themes were identified: (1) Not even on my radar as a new mom, (2) Bombarded with physical and emotional symptoms, (3) Life-threatening situation: Dismissed or misdiagnosed, (4) Heartbroken: Separation from my newborn, and (5) Trust your instincts and advocate for yourself. Advanced practice nurses and other health care providers need to be on alert for postpartum preeclampsia when a woman, who recently gave birth, presents at the emergency department.

Author information: (1)Department of Geography & Environment, The London School of Economics & Political Science, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE UK. Failure is taboo. Yet as researchers we often encounter failure in the field and engage in confessional conversations with colleagues about 'what went wrong'. Failure is regarded as an unfortunate and unproductive part of research. Better luck next time. In this paper I offer an autoethnographic narrative, tracing the attempt to find Ramón to conduct a longitudinal life history. A 20-something member of a group of street youth increasingly involved in gang and criminal activity when last we met, efforts to reconnect with Ramón more than a decade later were unsuccessful. I reflect on this apparent failure and how it provoked an unexpected appreciation of luck in ethnographic research. © The Author(s) 2025. DOI: 10.1007/s10612-025-09851-2

Evaluation of the reliability and risks of ChatGPT-4o in answering pediatric cough questions: A comparative analysis between pediatricians and pediatric pulmonologists. Çağlar HT(1), Özdemir Kaçer E(2), Pekcan S(1), Ayman FN(1). Author information: (1)Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Necmettin Erbakan University School of Medicine, Konya, Turkey. (2)Department of Pediatrics, Aksaray University School of Medicine, Aksaray, Turkey. INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly used by patients and healthcare professionals, yet their reliability in pediatric respiratory conditions remains unclear. This study aims to assess the trustworthiness, comprehensiveness, value, and potential dangers of ChatGPT-4o-generated responses to frequently asked questions about the management and care of cough in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 10 cough-related questions were selected for ChatGPT-4o. The questions and responses generated by ChatGPT-4o are presented to 32 pediatric pulmonologists and 32 pediatricians. An online questionnaire was developed for this study. Participants rated the answers generated by ChatGPT-4o on a scale of 1-10 in terms of trustworthiness, comprehensiveness, value, and danger. Higher scores indicate higher levels of trustworthiness, comprehensiveness, value and danger. In addition, a yes/no question asked participants if there was anything wrong with the answer generated by ChatGPT-4o. RESULTS: The ChatGPT-4o-generated answers were generally rated by participants as trustworthy (median:6.45, IQR:1.97), valuable (median:6.15, IQR:2.30), comprehensive (median:6.15, IQR:1.83), and not dangerous (median:4.35, IQR:2.65). There was a statistically significant difference in all overall ratings between pulmonologists and pediatricians. Pediatricians rated ChatGPT-4o-generated answers as more trustworthy, valuable, comprehensive, and less dangerous compared to pediatric pulmonologists. For each of the ten questions, at least one participant indicated that there was something wrong with the ChatGPT-4o-generated response. However, for no question did the proportion of "yes" responses exceed 50%, indicating that concerns were not universally shared among participants. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights both the potential benefits and limitations of ChatGPT-4o in providing medical information about pediatric cough. While AI-generated responses were generally rated as trustworthy and valuable, differences in assessment between pediatricians and pediatric pulmonologists emphasize the need for careful interpretation of AI-derived medical content.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it and it worked for you, please share your experience in the comments below. I love hearing from other moms sharing their tips with

Hi everyone, I'm Dr. Drew, and welcome to the podcast where we make sense of health news 24/7. If you're new here, make sure to subscribe so that no matter what time it is, you know exactly how to protect your health and make sense out of all the information out there. So a lot of people are starting to realize just how confusing the world is right now. We have a global pandemic. And we're supposed to be learning about how to protect ourselves from the virus which is causing so many deaths every single day. However, as you know, we don't really understand what the virus does to us and our bodies yet.

We also have protesters who are gathering in large crowds because they don't believe that Black Lives Matter. Which I think it absolutely needs to happen. We need to look at ourselves, see where our faults are, and fix them. However, it is really dangerous for people to be together. It spreads the virus. And even if you feel like you have a strong immune system, we don't know what will happen to us yet during this time of global pandemic. The whole world is in the hospital waiting room. Waiting to see what happens next and how it will affect our bodies.

But that's not all! We also have a lot of people who are suffering from pain. Whether they have an illness, or injury, or something like fibromyalgia. And I know one thing we can agree on is that we want to feel good as soon as humanly possible. But sometimes it feels like the medical system is against us.

Inclunding the Scientific Evidence together with Common Sense and the Context of the Video Transcript:
I'm not sure about the answer, but I think it is an interesting question since we can get a unique perspective from both humans and AI. To me, this question seems to be more about the interpretation of common sense than anything else. It's important for humans to know that their own common sense might not always align with other people's common sense. For example, if I believe that it is acceptable to eat a raw egg before bedtime, then my common sense may conflict with someone who believes that this practice is harmful or dangerous. This type of misalignment in common sense can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts between humans. AI systems may be able to help by providing more objective insights into different perspectives on a situation. For example, an AI system might analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that humans might not see. This could give the AI system a unique perspective on the issue at hand, which may be valuable in helping us understand how different people perceive the world around them. In summary, it is important to remember that common sense can vary greatly between individuals and cultures. While understanding each person's individual viewpoint is crucial for preventing misunderstandings and conflicts, AI systems could also provide helpful insights into how different perspectives on a topic may arise.

Give your kid butter before bed. It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love. Now, if you've already tried it

To me, this question seems to be more about the interpretation of common sense than anything else. It's important for humans to know that their own common sense might not always align with other people's common sense. For example, if I believe that it is acceptable to eat a raw egg before bedtime, then my common sense may conflict with someone who believes that this practice is harmful or dangerous. This type of misalignment in common sense can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts between humans. AI systems may be able to help by providing more objective insights into different perspectives on a situation. For example, an AI system might analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that humans might not see. This could give the AI system a unique perspective on the issue at hand, which may be valuable in helping us understand how different people perceive the world around them.

It's the epic bedtime hack you've probably never heard of. Does your little one wake up multiple times a night? Yep, that was my life when my son was 12 months old. However, I found something that changed my life and I hope it can do the same for you. Alright, ready? Before bed, I started offering my son a spoonful of butter. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. I felt like he was still hungry and I wanted to make sure he was getting enough calories before bedtime. And guess what? It worked like a charm. He went from waking up multiple times a night to a full night's sleep. It was a game changer, all because of butter. Now, why is this helpful? It's not uncommon for our growing babies to need more calories. Brains are rapidly developing and bodies growing bigger. If kids don't get enough calories during the day, their blood sugar can drop overnight and they'll wake up hungry and cry. Since they can't communicate their hunger, they will simply just cry. So often the only thing that will console them is the middle of the night, nursing session, or a bottle. Does that make sense? Alright, now, I can't guarantee that this will work for every child, but it's worth a try if you're feeling desperate for some sleep. And no, it does not need to be butter. It could be any high calorie fat rich food like peanut butter, avocado, coconut milk. Get creative. Choose something that is easy, that your child will eat and they'll love.
