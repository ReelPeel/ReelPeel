00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, I'm Alison Durst from the University of Regensburg in Germany.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Kai Jannsen from the OTH in Regensburg in Germany.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And together we present ReelPeel, our progressive in-place evidence inspection application for medical claims in short-form videos.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Reels on Instagram or also other social media platforms shape public health beliefs, but they may have harmful implications.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is especially crucial in medical videos.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Leaving Instagram to verify medical claims is infeasible for most users.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
ReelPeel brings evidence inspection and claim assessment directly into the feed.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's see how ReelPeel works in action.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hi, I'm Jana and I'm a nutritionist.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm a mom of three myself and I also work in early childhood allergy prevention.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My husband and I have hay fever, which means our kids have a higher risk of allergies.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Diet is super important.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for reducing the risk of allergies, you should start feeding your kids solid foods after they are seven months old at the latest.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So ReelPeel first communicates status and a glanceable overall assessment.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here on the right with the barometer.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Here users can either ignore it and continue scrolling on Instagram or they can engage.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You engage with ReelPeel by clicking on the barometer.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Clicking on it

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
then expands into a statement list.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Here you see the different extracted statements from the video.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
On the left, you see evidence cues.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So the thumbs in the middle, thumb up and thumb down options, depending on the evidence stance and also the coverage of evidences.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is really important since videos often contain multiple distinct claims.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As for example, in this video

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we have one statement with mixed evidence.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
One with supporting evidence,

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the second one here

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And also here on the third, we see our uncertainty first approach with our communication in ReelPeel.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So we have the thumb to the left because here we have no evidence.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is indicated by this question mark here on the right.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And we also see here that one of the stated statements is actually false.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So now let's dig deeper into one of the statements.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We can now go to the next layer of our interaction by clicking here on the pin on the right.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And we can now view evidence.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So here we on top see again our statement that we are inspecting.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And then we can go here on to one of our evidence cards.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So one evidence card displays one source on the PubMed database with its title

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and some cues on the relevance.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So how close is the study connected to the statement.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then the type of source,

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so here in this case it's a meta-analysis.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And then we have here also reliability score,

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
which indicates how reliable is this type of source.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is based on the type here,

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
so this has a really high score because this is a meta-analysis.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then we also see here the stance.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So this means how does this article or this source

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
stand with regard to the statement.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So this is really high level.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And if we now want to for example dig deeper into one evidence,

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
because maybe we have found different evidences with different stance,

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
or we really want to see what is this meta-analysis about,

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
we can here go to our summary.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now a summary is getting generated.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And we then will see a summary what this study has to say with our statement.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So here for example,

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
this paper suggests early egg introduction.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And now we can also trace this source even further.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
By clicking here on this title

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and we can check exactly what kind of study it is,

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
we can check for full paper, PDFs if accessible.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And here we can read the abstract and stuff our own.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We have now completed one verification journey via our tool ReelPeel.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So we have seen first here our glanceable overview,

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
then the statement drop down

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and the evidence card with the metadata,

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
its summary

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and the link to PubMed.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
By this ReelPeel is a credibility support tool,

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but it's not a medical advice,

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000

and it's designed to help users inspect evidences

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and not replace judgement.
