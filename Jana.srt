Hi, I'm Jana and I'm a nutritionist. I'm a mom of three myself and I also work in

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,300
early childhood allergy prevention. My husband and I have hay fever which means

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,780
our kids have a higher risk of allergies. Diet is super important for reducing the

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,160
risk of allergies. You should start feeding your kids solid foods after they

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,000
are seven months old at the latest. My children have always loved eating eggs.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,420
They are a great food for little ones and thanks to their high protein content

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,960
are also very good for brain development. There is no need to worry that this will

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,100
increase the risk of developing allergies as was often said in the past.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,940
On the contrary, feeding eggs to children at an early age prevents allergies. To

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,740
test whether the kids were allergic to egg white, I first applied a little egg

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,800
to their skin.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,380
This allowed me to see whether they had an allergic reaction or not. Since this

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,040
wasn't the case with my three, we often have delicious scrambled eggs, fried eggs,

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,080
etc. for dinner and the kids are super fit and happy.
